  <Entry Index="0">Hey. So, uh, have you heard anything from your dad
lately?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1">Nope. Not a word. Not only did he up and leave Mom
when she's so sick, he hasn't checked in even once.
What a jerk, huh?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2">Talk about selfish, just up and leaving
Mom when she's so sick!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3">Whoa, maybe retract those fangs a little, bud. He DID
leave because he's looking for a cure for your mom, right?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I don't think that's something a person would do unless
they really cared about their family.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4">Well...yeah. Okay. Maybe.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="5">And since he's not here, you've gotta step up and take
care of both your mom and Popuri. Got it?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="6">Well, duh. Of course I know that!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="7">Good! On that note, what say we head home?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="8">Yeah. And, um... Thanks, Karen.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="9">Man, we sure played together a lot when we were kids.
Do you remember, Karen?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="10">Yup. We came up with all kinds of games to play.
Kick the Can, Hide-and-Seek, Tag...
You name it, we played it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="11">Haha! Yep! Heck, we even wrestled for a while, too.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Don't think I ever beat you, either. You taught me at a
very young age exactly what a mouthful of dirt tastes
like.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="12">H-Hey, I call shenanigans! I mean, it's not as if I was
stomping around town like some muscle-bound freak.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="13">Uh, yes you were? I clearly remember you flinging me
around like a sack of turnips until I ran home crying.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="14">Lies and slander! I don't remember ANY of that. Nope!
Not at all! You're making it up just to mess with me,
aren't you?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
That does it. I'm leaving!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="15">Huh? What are you so mad for? Um, Karen?
Kaaaren...! Come back!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="16">Mmm, that was so yummy!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Boy, Kai, everything you serve at your Cafe is so new and
interesting! We don't have anything like it here in town.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="17">How do you know so much about so many different
places?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="18">Dude, whaaat? Do I really seem like that much
of a know-it-all?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Haha! I mean, I travel a lot, so I pick up some stuff here
and there, but there's still tons I don't know.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
That's why whenever I find a new dish or ingredient,
I get my butt into the kitchen and run a little taste test.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Not only do I like learning new stuff, but I wanna keep
updating my menu with fresh and exotic dishes.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="19">Wooow, really? That's so neat! You sure have a cool and
mature way of thinking about stuff, Kai.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="20">Naaah, I'm not all that. Y'see, just between you and me...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I can't stand the cold. Like, seriously. That's why when it
starts getting chilly here, I take off for somewhere
warmer.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="21">Avoiding the chill was the main reason I first started
moving from place to place like I do. Kind of a dumb
reason, right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="22">Hee hee! Kai, you're so silly!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="23">Hey, Kai, I wonder... Do you think that if Mom had some of
your cooking, she would feel better and happier?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="24">I dunno! Wanna try it out? I can drop by your place and
whip something up.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="25">Ooh, will you really?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="26">Yep, you bet! Just leave it to me!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="27">Wow! Thanks so much, Kai!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="28">Kai is really super-duper nice.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="29">Okay, what would be best, I wonder...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="30">I'm real glad your mom liked my cooking, Popuri.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="31">Me too. Thanks so much for coming over and doing that,
just like you said you would. It made me so happy!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="32">No prob! Let's just hope it puts some pep
in your mom's step.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="33">Yeah!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="34">Still...I'm really glad Rick wasn't home when you
came over.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If he found you here, I just know he'd be super-duper
upset.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="35">Good point.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="36">Popuri! There you are!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="37">What are you doing here, of all places? Kai, do me a favor
and stop dragging my sister halfway across town.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="38">Hey! Don't be rude! I was just talking with him.
Is that a crime all of a sudden?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="39">Anyway! You're supposed to be back at the store
helping me. Let's go.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="40">Hmph! If you're so worried about the store, you can take
care of it all by yourself!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="41">Wha-- Popuri, how could you say that?!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
This is YOUR fault, Kai. You're the one putting ideas in
my sister's head. Knock it off!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="42">Stop saying mean things about Kai! You don't get
anything, Rick! You're being a horrible jerk!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="43">Sis, why can't you--&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="44">Popuri, you should probably get going. Your mom's gonna
worry, y'know?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="45">Huh? Awww! But I...
Okay. I guess you're right, Kai.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="46">Let's go, Popuri. Kai, you stay away from my sister.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="47">I'm sorry about this, Kai. I'll see you later, okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="48">Sure. Get home safe, 'kay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="49">Dang, you heard all that? Sorry you had to sit through...
whatever that was.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Rick can be pretty annoying, eh? If he ever catches me
chatting with Popuri, he comes charging up, mad as a bull.
Ugh.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="50">Oh...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="51">Hey there, Cliff.
How do you like it here?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="52">Hey...
Uh... No complaints.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="53">Oh, that's good to hear!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="54">Now that I think of it, we don't talk very often, do we?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="55">I...guess we don't.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="56">So, why'd you come to this town?
To sightsee? Or for work? Ooh, or maybe--&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="57">Sorry, I...
I don't wanna talk about it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="58">Oh... S-Sorry.
I shouldn't have pried. Bad habit.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="59">If you ever have a problem or need help with something,
just let me know, okay?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Well, I've still got work to do.
Bye!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="60">Oh... Um...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="61">Yeees?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="62">I, uh...
Thanks, Ran.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="63">You betcha!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="64">...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="65">Cliff, you ought to try speaking with the townspeople
more. They are all very nice people, I assure you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="66">Yeah, but... It's awkward. And no one seems to actually
enjoy talking with me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="67">You don't say? That's odd.
You speak normally with me, and I enjoy our
conversations well enough.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="68">Because you're not like other people. Normal people,
they... It's like...they perceive me differently,
or something.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="69">What is it that makes me "not like other people,"
I wonder...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="70">Hello, Carter!
Oh, and Cliff's with you too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="71">Hello, Ran.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="72">...Hey.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="73">You are something of a rare sight around the Church,
Ran.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
What brings you here this afternoon?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="74">Uh, you DID order delivery, didn't you? Otherwise,
I'm here with somebody else's lunch.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="75">Oh! I had completely forgotten.
You are absolutely right.
Thank you very much.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="76">Huh, you're more of a space case than I thought, Carter.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Well, here you are.
Our special lunch, just for you!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="77">By the way, what're YOU doing here at the Church,
Cliff? Praying? Confessing? CLEANING?! I have this
great wax--&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="78">Uh... Oh...
Nothing, really.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="79">Good grief.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="80">Ran, I have a request for you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="81">Huh? What is it?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="82">It's about Cliff. He is extremely shy, so he finds it difficult
to speak with the townspeople.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="83">W-Wait, Carter. What're you...?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="84">I want to help you learn to get along with the
townspeople, so I'm calling in some conversational muscle,
as it were.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="85">He's got a terminal case of shyness, huh? So THAT'S
why...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="86">Okay, I'll do it! I'll be his partner-in-cri--er, conversation!
Just leave it to me!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="87">What?!
I-I didn't agree to--&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="88">Don't you worry! I'll rid you of that fear of strangers
faster than I can scrub a stubborn stain outta linens!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="89">All right, I still have some work to do at the Inn,
so I'm heading back.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Goodbye, Carter.
See you at the Inn, Cliff.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="90">Yes, of course.
Goodbye, Ran.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="91">...Right.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="92">Carter...
Why would you do that to me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="93">Rest easy, my child.
Ran will be the perfect partner.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="94">Something I can help you with, Marie?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="95">The tool you repaired for me is so very easy
to use, I wanted to come thank you again
for your craftsmanship.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I appreciate it very much.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="96">Well, if you're that pleased by it, then I'm glad
I repaired it for you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If you ever need my expertise again, come straight on
over and see me, all right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="97">Yes! Thank you so much!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="98">Ow!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="99"></Entry>
  <Entry Index="100">...Don't mind me. It's nothing.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="101">Oh no, you're bleeding.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="102">Idiot. It's because you lost focus.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="103">I said I'm fine.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="104">No, you aren't!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="105">Wait just a second. Um...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="106">Oh, there it is.
Give me your hand, Gray.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="107">That should do it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="108">Th-Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="109">Oh, no, it's my pleasure.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="110">All right, I'll be going now. I hope to see you two
at the Library someday.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="111">We'll be sure to drop by sometime.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="112">I promise to visit.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="113">I'm glad. Goodbye for now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="114">Marie sure is nice.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="115">Ugh... How many times have I told that boy to keep his
eyes on his work?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="116">Oh, hello there, Gray.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="117">Hello.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="118">Not many people in this town read books, so I hardly
get any visitors. Thank you for stopping by.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="119">Wonder why that is? It's not like you're hurting
for interesting books here.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="120">I'm glad to hear you think so.
Oh, that's right...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="121">To be honest, I'm writing a novel right now.
Just as a hobby, mind you. But I haven't had
many people read through it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="122">If it wouldn't be too much of a bother, would you mind
reading it and telling me what you think?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="123">YOU'RE writing a book?
That's...that's amazing!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="124">It's nothing that impressive, really.
So, will you help me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="125">'Course. If you're all right with me reading it,
I'd love to help.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="126">Wonderful. I'll bring it to you later.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="127">Right.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="128">It's a little embarrassing to show it to other people,
but I do think I need feedback if I want to refine it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="129">A novel written by you, huh?
Wow. I can't wait to read it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="130">*sigh*&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="131">Are you fatigued?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="132">No, I'm fine.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="133">Please don't overwork yourself. If you were to collapse,
there would be no shortage of townspeople in distress.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="134">Oh, Doctor...
Are you worried about me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="135">Naturally. No good physician would be pleased to see an
increase in sick patients due to his staff's negligence.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="136">*sigh* Oh, is that all?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="137">What's the matter?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="138">No, it's nothing.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="139">Hm? Well, if you say so.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="140">Is Elly truly all right? She seems more enervated
than ever.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="141">*sigh*&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="142">Grandma, how are you feeling?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="143">Oh, much better now, dear.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="144">Thank goodness.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="145">It seems it was just a cold.
Please keep warm and get plenty of rest.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="146">Thank you, Doctor.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="147">No thanks necessary. More importantly, how are your
legs doing?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="148">Hm... About the same as always, I'd say.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="149">...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="150">I apologize.
If I were only more skilled...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="151">You've nothing to trouble yourself over, Doctor.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="152">Yes, she's right. You've already gone above and beyond
for my grandmother!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="153">I...appreciate that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="154">Doctor, it's about time to get back to the Clinic.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="155">Right.
Well then, take care.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="156">Thank you, Doctor.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="157">The word "grateful" hardly captures how I feel.
Elly and Doctor have been so good to me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="158">I really look up to Doctor!
And I'm sure Elly does, too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
