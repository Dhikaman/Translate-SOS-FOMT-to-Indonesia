  <Entry Index="0">Ah ha! It looks like &lt;string0&gt;
is pregnant.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1">Huh? Nothing happened.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2">I don't have a Breeding Bin available.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3">My Barn is too full. I can't take in any more animals.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4">&lt;playername&gt;, hello. Do you have a moment?
I have a favor to ask...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="5">You see, this little foal of mine here isn't feeling too well.
It needs a little extra care.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Unfortunately, I don't have the time to give it that care.
I was hoping you might raise it for me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="6">Ah, but I would truly appreciate your help with this...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="7">Or...can you not do it?</Entry>
  <Entry Index="8">Accept</Entry>
  <Entry Index="9">Decline</Entry>
  <Entry Index="10">I see. Well, if you can't, then you can't. I won't bother you
with this again. Good day.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="11">You will? Good, good! I knew I could count on you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Well then, why not give this little one a name?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="12">There isn't much to worry yourself over when it comes
to raising horses.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Just give â€˜em lots of love and care, and that'll be plenty.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Talk to them every day, yeah? They do love
hearing your voice.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Brushing them every day is good for them too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="13">All right, then. I'll take this little one on over
to your Stable.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="14">Once it's grown, I'll come back for it.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Take good care of it for me until then.
I'm counting on you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="15">&lt;playername&gt;, hello. I've come to check in on little
&lt;string0&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm thinking it should be about grown by now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="16">Hrm... Mm-hmm... Mm-hmm...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="17">Good, good! I can tell you spent the last 90 days raising
&lt;string0&gt; with lots of love and care.
You've done a fine job. You pass.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="18">As thanks for your hard work, I don't mind letting you
keep &lt;string0&gt; as your own.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
They seem like they're quite fond of you, after all.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Well then, keep taking excellent care of little...
Well, big &lt;string0&gt; now.
I know I can count on you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="19">Hrm... Mm-hmm... Mm-hmm...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="20">No, no, no. This won't do at all, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's been an entire year, but you haven't shown
&lt;string0&gt; enough love.
I'm afraid I have to fail you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="21">I'll be taking &lt;string0&gt; back home
with me, then. Good day.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="22">&lt;playername&gt;, hello. I can't help but notice you don't
have a single horse on your farm.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="23">This here is one that I raised. I'll let you have it.
It'll make things seem a bit more farm-y.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You can give it a name too, if you'd like.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="24">Now then, I'll go take this little one to your barn.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Show it lots of love every day, y'hear? Don't forget to
talk to it and give it a good brushing.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="25">I'll leave &lt;myhorsename&gt; in your care, then. Good day.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
