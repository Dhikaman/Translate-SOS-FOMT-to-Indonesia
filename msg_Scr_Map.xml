  <Entry Index="63">Now, pray tell me, what is it that weighs upon your mind?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="64">I hardly sleep.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="65">I overwork the Nature Sprites.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="66">I want to marry Kappa.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="67">Getting a proper amount of sleep is very important for
your health.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I understand you're busy, but I highly recommend taking
some time to recharge physically and mentally.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Be at ease. All has been forgiven. The divine bless you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="68">What do you mean you hardly sleep?! The rhythms of
waking and resting are a natural process set by the
heavens!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Do you mean to desecrate that holy order by refusing to
partake in it?! Blasphemy, I say! Blasphemy!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The divine have no forgiveness for sinners like you!
Heavenly retribution will surely rain down from above!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="69">The Nature Sprites are benevolent creatures that give
help out of the goodness of their hearts.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Perhaps you ought to return the favor with a thank-you
gift to show your appreciation for all that they do.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Be at ease. All has been forgiven. The divine bless you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="70">What? You're ABUSING the good will of the Nature
Sprites and overworking them?! How dare you!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
"We help you out of the goodness of our hearts," I can
hear them say. "Making us work without saying thank
you is mean!"&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I would be utterly unsurprised if they are absolutely
furious.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The divine have no forgiveness for sinners like you!
Heavenly retribution will surely rain down from above!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Hrm! Ahem! ...Goodness, their high voices are quite the
workout for one's vocal cords.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="71">You want to marry Kappa...? My, I wasn't aware you had
such strong feelings for it.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm sure that Kappa is aware of how powerfully you care
for it as well.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Be at ease. All has been forgiven. The divine bless you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="72">Wh-What...? You want to marry Kappa?! What in
Heaven's name are you saying?!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Kappa is not human! It is a guardian spirit of the lake,
nearly divine in its own right!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Why, I've lamented many a time over my inability to
marry the Harvest Goddess, but--&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
AHEM! Erm! Yes! Please forget I said that. Anyway!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The divine have no forgiveness for sinners like you!

  <Entry Index="73">I don't care for my animals.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="74">I worked myself to collapse.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="75">The townsfolk don't like me.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="76">The animals you keep provide you with that which you
can eat, drink, and sell from their own bodies because
they care for you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Please consider their care as well, if only to repay them
for all that they freely give to you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Be at ease. All has been forgiven. The divine bless you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="77">What on earth do you think your animals are? Machines?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
They are giving their Milk and their Wool--parts of
themselves--to you out of care and love for you!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Don't you feel the least desire to show any love and care
to them in return?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I must say, I have nothing but pity for the poor creatures
kept by someone so heartless and cruel.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The divine have no forgiveness for sinners like you!
Heavenly retribution will surely rain down from above!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="78">That is quite the work ethic you have if you are toiling
until collapse. But please, you must think of your health.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If you fainted, that means you have pushed your body far
beyond the limits of what is good and healthy.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Next time you tire, I highly recommend you re-energize
yourself with food and rest before working again.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Be at ease. All has been forgiven. The divine bless you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="79">My word! Have you no respect at all for the body that
your parents gifted you with?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Do you enjoy torturing yourself? Is ruining your health
fun? Take better care of your sacred vessel!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The divine have no forgiveness for sinners like you!
Heavenly retribution will surely rain down from above!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="80">The people of this town would not turn against you for no
good reason. There must be a cause.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Look deep within your heart and see if you have an idea
what it may be. If you do, repent and apologize.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Be at ease. All has been forgiven. The divine bless you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="81">How funny. I find that I dislike being around you as well.
Let's wrap this up quickly, shall we?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The divine have no forgiveness for sinners like you.
Heavenly retribution will surely rain down from above!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="82">I picked on an animal.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="83">I overslept.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="84">I littered on the road.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="85">The human heart is a fragile thing. Thus, at times, we are
seized with a need to put down others to feel better
about ourselves.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But such actions are proof of our weakness. Those who
can't realize that will forever be a slave to insecurity.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Be at ease. All has been forgiven. The divine bless you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="86">H-How could you...?! I did not take you for such a cruel
and cold individual.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Did you enjoy tormenting that poor creature?
Was it fun to lord it over them?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If you did feel that way, then I am afraid there is no hope
of salvation for you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The divine have no forgiveness for sinners like you.
Heavenly retribution will surely rain down from above!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="87">Unlike the human heart, the human body is very
forthright. Oversleeping is not a sin in and of itself.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Be at ease. All has been forgiven. The divine bless you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="88">Oversleeping is a sign of poor discipline and lack of
devotion to your daily responsibilities.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
There are those whose schedules may be disrupted when
you oversleep. No one likes a person who isn't punctual.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The divine have no forgiveness for sinners like you.
Heavenly retribution will surely rain down from above!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="89">If you have generated some sort of waste, it is only
natural that you put that garbage in a proper
receptacle.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If it is garbage generated by someone else, it is a kindness
to put it in a bin for them.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Be at ease. All has been forgiven. The divine bless you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="90">...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I am so flabbergasted I don't know what to say.
What would you think if someone littered in
your home?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You would be upset, would you not? This is the same thing.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The divine have no forgiveness for sinners like you.
