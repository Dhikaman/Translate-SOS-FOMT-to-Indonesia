way, right?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Ah, so your name is &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Hi. I'm Rick. I live in town with my mom

It's good to meet you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2">Wow, thanks! That's my &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I knew you'd remember my birthday.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3">Oh, wow! Thanks! Today's my birthday, even!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4">Wow, thanks! This is my most favorite food, too.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You're so considerate, &lt;nickname&gt;. Boy, now I'm
going to have to get something for you. Hmm...what would
be good?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="5">Thanks! I really like everything egg and egg-adjacent, and
not just because I grew up on a chicken farm.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
This is a particular favorite of mine.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="6">Ooh! Thanks. You know me so well, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I certainly picked the right girl to marry, huh?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="7">Ooh! Thanks. You know me so well, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

  <Entry Index="13">Ooh, is this for me? Thanks, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="14">Ooh, is this for me? Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="15">Er... Don't get me wrong, I'm always grateful for the
thought behind any present you give me,
&lt;nickname&gt;...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But, uh, I'd appreciate it if you picked something else
next time.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="16">Um...thanks? I guess?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="17">WHAT THE FLAP?! EW! Not that! Of all things,
not that! What the heck were you thinking,
&lt;nickname&gt;?!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="18">EGG-SCUSE ME?! EW! Are you really giving this to me?!
What the heck were you thinking?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="19">They're so dang cute. I swear, I get the warm fuzzies
every time I see them. Don't you, &lt;nickname&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="20">Man, they're SO cute!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="21">&lt;nickname&gt;, don't take that anywhere near our
coop, please and thanks. You'll send the chickens into
a frenzy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="22">I try to keep all other animals out of our chicken coop.
The chickens panic and stress out if they get too close.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="23">Oh, that's pretty. If you don't want it, &lt;nickname&gt;,
I'll give it to Mom.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="24">Oh, that's pretty. I don't really need it myself, but I bet
Mom would love it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="25">Is that yours, &lt;nickname&gt;? Neat!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I wouldn't use it myself. Maybe I should give it to Mom?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="26">Huh? This is for me? To be honest, I don't have much use
for it.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I wonder if Mom would like it...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="27">Sorry, I tend not to wear this sort of thing. Haven't I told
you that before?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="28">Sorry, I tend not to wear this sort of thing. Just FYI for
next time.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="29">Uh...thanks, &lt;nickname&gt;. But you DO remember
today's the day for guys to give presents to girls, right...?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="30">Uh...thanks, &lt;nickname&gt;. I guess this IS the right
occasion to be handing out presents.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="31">Uh...thanks. But you DO remember that today's supposed
to be the girls' turn to receive presents, right...?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="32">You're sure it's okay for me to have this? Thanks!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="33">Wow. Even now that we're married, you still
remembered to get me a Valentine's Day present.
Thanks, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="34">Wow. Even now that we're married, you still
remembered to get me a Valentine's Day present.
Thanks, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="35">Ooh, thanks!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I didn't get you anything for White Day, yet you still got
something for me. I almost feel guilty accepting it.
Thanks!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="36">Hm? Oh, you remembered that I got you something for
White Day and wanted to give me something in return?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Thanks! That's so kind of you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

  <Entry Index="45">Wow, you're getting married? Congrats! I bet it'll be a
big help having another person around your farm, huh?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="46">Ah. A Preserved Flower. For me, I assume?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Um... I'm really flattered you feel that way, but I'm afraid
we aren't quite on the same page.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="47">Um... I'm flattered you'd offer, really, but I think it's a bit
too soon for us. Sorry.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="48">Hey, this is just the latest scuttlebutt, but a farm over in
Forgotten Valley is supposed to have a lot of animals.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

  <Entry Index="51">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;. You know tomorrow is Starlight
Night, right?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
My family will be throwing a little party to mark the

  <Entry Index="53">The party don't start till I walk in!</Entry>
  <Entry Index="54">Sorry. I can't make it.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="55">So you'll come? Cool! Plan to arrive at my place by
6:00 PM, then. We'll be waiting for you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="56">Really? Aw, that's too bad. I guess you DO have all your
farm work to think of. Oh well.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="57">We'll be throwing a little party for Starlight Night
tomorrow. Be sure you're home by 6:00 PM, okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="58">Man, to think our baby is right here in your tummy,
turning into more of a little person every single day.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's crucial for you to take care of yourself now. Promise
me you won't stay out late and get a chill, okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="59">Do you have morning sickness at all? I hear that's
supposed to be rough. &lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
As a guy, I can't even begin to imagine how uncomfortable
that must be. I'm on call if you need anything, okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="60">You're looking a lot better now.
Is the baby moving around at all?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="61">If you feel something, let me know, okay? I wonder if
we're in for a son or a daughter...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If it's a girl, I think you should be the one to name her,
&lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="62">How are you feeling? You aren't too tired or anything,
are you?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="63">I hear it's good for you to get a little bit of exercise
during pregnancy. Man, I can't wait to be a dad!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="64">The baby is supposed to arrive tomorrow, right?
I've asked Elly and Doctor to come over,
just in case.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="65">I'll spend all day at home with you tomorrow, okay?
And you should probably get to sleep early tonight, too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="66">Eyelids...heavy... Sheesh. I guess sleepless nights are just
part and parcel of raising an infant, huh?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="67">Eesh. Our little one doesn't sleep for more than
a few hours at a time, so we can't either.
Are you holding up okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="68">Our baby really has my eyes, wouldn't you say? I think
somebody is going to grow up to look a lot like Papa!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="69">Our baby's eyes really resemble mine, huh? I hope our
little one will grow up to take after the both of us!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="70">I just can't take my eyes off of our baby. So precious.
I think we've got a little weight gain going on, too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="71">Agh, so cute! It's really fun to watch a child grow. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="72">I wonder what we should do tomorrow?
Geez, even at work, I can't stop thinking about our baby.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="73">&lt;nickname&gt;, you aren't too tired, are you?
Are you feeling okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="74">I imagine it's hard to be on your feet. I'm tired just
watching you! Why don't you rest and let me handle
things?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="75">It feels like babies grow so quickly. Doesn't it seem that
way to you too?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I wonder what sort of person &lt;childname&gt; will
grow up to be. The anticipation is killing me.
Okay, bad word choice...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="76">Oh, but aren't girls supposed to be more rebellious
towards their dads? Oof, I hope that never happens
with ours...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="77">Sorry. For some reason, I'm just not in the mood
to chat today.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="78">Could you give me some space, please?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="79">Good morning, &lt;nickname&gt;. Been really busy
as of late?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="80">Hey, um... I know this will probably seem like it's coming
out of nowhere, but...I miss you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="81">Is it me, or have we not talked all that much lately?
Maybe...maybe it IS just me. I hope.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="82">If you don't set aside more time for us to spend together
as a couple, then I'm not sure I know why we're still
married.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="83">If you don't set aside more time for us to spend together
as a couple, then I'm not sure I know why we're still
married.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="84">Good morning. Did you sleep well? You aren't stressing
yourself out too much, are you?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="85">I don't mean to make assumptions about what you can
and can't handle, but I'm worried for you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="86">How have you been feeling? You aren't overworking
yourself, I hope?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="87">Try not to work too much after midnight, okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="88">Morning, &lt;nickname&gt;. Let's both hit today with
everything we've got. Come see me over at the chicken
farm, too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="89">&lt;nickname&gt;, you doing okay on your own? Just say
the word if you need anything. Remember, you aren't
alone anymore. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="90">So, how was your day? It's important for a couple to have
good communication, y'know. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="91">So, how was your day? It's important for a couple to have
good communication, y'know. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="92">There's no rush, though. We're going to be together for
a long, looong time.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="93">Morning, &lt;nickname&gt;. ∀ Let's both give it our best
out there, okay? It's a new day full of exciting potential.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="94">Morning, &lt;nickname&gt;. ∀ Let's both give it our best
out there, okay? It's a new day full of exciting potential.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="95">With you in my corner, &lt;nickname&gt;, I feel like I can
do anything. I feel so lucky to be your husband. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="96">With you in my corner, &lt;nickname&gt;, I feel like I can

  <Entry Index="97">How is the farm doing? Let me know if there's anything
I can do to help out.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="98">I'm probably stating the obvious, but I think you're most in
your element with your sleeves rolled up on the farm.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="99">Oh, hey, &lt;nickname&gt;. Here to do some shopping?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Remember, you're driving for two right now.
Take it easy, okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="100">What's that?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You think I'm taking this whole fatherhood thing a little
too seriously? Heh. I'll take that as a compliment.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="101">Hey, &lt;nickname&gt;. What's up?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="102">Oh, uh, I was just wondering if anything was going on with
&lt;childname&gt;, so I came to check. Can Papa have a
little visit?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="103">Oh, uh... Hey, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="104">Could you give me a little breathing room for a minute?
I'm thinking about something.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="105">Oh. Hey, &lt;nickname&gt;. Something up?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="106">If you don't need me for anything, could you leave me
alone, please?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="107">Hey, what's up? Come to check on the chickens?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="108">Or are you here to check up on me instead? I'm doing just
fine. Everything's peachy keen.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="109">Hey, &lt;nickname&gt;. How's the farm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="110">It's such a relief knowing home is just a short jaunt away.
If anything happens, I can run straight there.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="111">Oh, hey, &lt;nickname&gt;. So you came to see me, huh?
Aww. Make yourself at home.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="112">Man, uh, it still makes my cheeks a little flushed, meeting
like this somewhere other than home.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="113">Hey, how's it going? Everything's great on my end.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="114">Apparently, Mom has been waiting ages for me and
Karen to get married, and for her to move in with us.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="115">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;. How's it going?
Things are great on my end.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="116">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;. How's it going?
Things are great on my end.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="117">Man, marriage is SO worth it. It has been such a relief to
have Karen in my corner.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="118">Hey. Don't forget to drop by my store sometimes, too.
My chickens lay the best eggs around.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="119">My childhood friend works over at the General Store.
Her name's Karen. She's a really nice gal.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Have you met her yet?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="120">Phew! Feeding all these chickens day in and day out
is a lot of work.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="121">It'd be so much easier if Dad came back home to help.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="122">Karen's a heck of a friend. We can talk to each other
about anything. I mean, we've been together since we
were kids.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="123">Back then, I pretty much played with her and her alone.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
We had so much fun goofing around together...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="124">Y'know, recently, I've started to realize just how
important Karen really is to me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="125">It's still too embarrassing to tell her that, though.
Promise me you'll keep this a secret! Please?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="126">It's still too embarrassing to tell her that, though.
Promise me you'll keep this a secret! Please?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="127">It's weird. For some reason, Karen has been awfully quiet
as of late. She's usually on my case about SOMETHING...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="128">No one understands me quite like Karen does. Not even
Popuri, if I'm being honest.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
She's my sister, sure, but she's always snippy with me,
telling me to shut up or leave her alone. It's a shame.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="129">Oh, hey, &lt;playername&gt;. What's up?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="130">Oh, hey, &lt;playername&gt;. What's up?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="131">We really are getting married, aren't we? You and me.
Married. ∀&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You're going to wear a wedding dress and everything.
I can't wait to see it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="132">We really are getting married, aren't we? You and me.
Married. ∀&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You're going to wear a nice tuxedo and everything.
I can't wait to see it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="133">Hey. How's the farm doing? It's business as usual over
here. Our chickens are happy and thriving.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="134">It takes a lot of strength to start from nothing and make
it into something, I bet.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="135">Hey, how's it going? Getting used to all your farm chores?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="136">Let me know if you need anything. We're neighbors now,
after all.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="137">Hi, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="138">Hi, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="139">We grind our chickens' feed with our water mill.
I'm pretty sure you ought to have one on your farm,
too, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="140">We grind our chickens' feed with our water mill.
I'm pretty sure you ought to have one on your farm,

  <Entry Index="141">Chickens may look the same at a glance, but if you look
closely, you'll start noticing all their little differences.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="142">...You still can't tell? Huh. I guess it's harder for some
people than others. I'll teach you a trick or two later.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="143">...You still can't tell? Huh. You know how some people have
face blindness? Maybe that's you, but with chickens.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="144">Man, caring for a life is a lot of hard work and

  <Entry Index="146">But y'know? Watching them every day, you get to know
each one of them and their adorable quirks. It's never

  <Entry Index="147">Oh, hey, &lt;playername&gt;. How's the farm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="148">Oh, hey, &lt;playername&gt;. How's the farm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="155"></Entry>
  <Entry Index="156">It's funny. Without Karen around, I feel like I'm
floundering. I'd better head home as soon as I can.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="157">Karen's an only child, so I bet Jeff gets really lonely not
having her around the house anymore.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Not that Sasha doesn't look for any excuse she can to
come visit us, either.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

Still the same ol', same ol'?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="322">You're lucky, &lt;playername&gt;. You get to play with the
animals you take care of aaall the time.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Sometimes, I really miss getting to play with our
chickens...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="323">Oh, hi, &lt;playername&gt;. Working hard today?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="324">I always wanted to travel the world, but now that I have,
I think I like this town even more than I used to.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="325">Boy, &lt;playername&gt;, you look more and more grown-
up with every year I come to visit.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I guess that's kind of an obvious thing to say, huh? Duh,
Popuri.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="326">Kai is so silly. I keep telling him we can just stay at my
family's place when we come to visit...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But he always insists on staying at the inn. I wonder why.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="327">Oh, hi, &lt;playername&gt;. Y'know, when I think about it,
it's a little sad that I only get to visit here in summer.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="328">Every time I come back to visit, I can't help but wonder if
this time, Dad will have come home...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But I guess it wasn't meant to happen this year either.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="329">Karen is super dependable and on top of stuff. She helps
me sooo much.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="330">Whenever he's with Karen, Rick is super nice and sweet.
That's waaay different than what he's like with me!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="331">Oh, hi, &lt;playername&gt;. How's little &lt;childname&gt;
doing? Well, I hope?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="332">So, um, can I ask you a favor? Could you tell
&lt;childname&gt; not to call me "Auntie"?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="333">Being called "Auntie Popuri" makes me feel like
a wrinkly old lady, so could you get &lt;childname&gt;
to stop? Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="334">Rick isn't nagging you to death, is he? You aren't getting
sick of it? I'm worried for you, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="335">Boy, you really ARE a good person, &lt;playername&gt;.
You even know how to put up with all of Rick's nonsense.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="336">Oh, hi, &lt;playername&gt;. How are you doing?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="337">Please say hi to your spouse for me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="338">Please say hi to your spouse for me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="339">Oh, hi, &lt;playername&gt;. I guess you've got a lot to do
around the farm like always, huh?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="340">Are you SURE you should be hanging out around here?
Isn't there somebody waiting for you at home?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="341">Are you SURE you should be hanging out around here?
Isn't there somebody waiting for you at home?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="342">Hi, &lt;playername&gt;! How's the farm?
Still the same ol', same ol'?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="343">&lt;playername&gt;, I bet you're really good to your
spouse. They're so lucky to have you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="344">Hee hee! I still can't believe we get to be married!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="345">Hee hee! I still can't believe we get to be married!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="346">Ugh, I wish Dad would just come home already! He's going
to miss seeing his precious daughter get married!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="347">Ugh, I wish Dad would just come home already! He's going
to miss seeing his precious daughter get married!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="348">Oh, that's right! You haven't met my dad yet,
have you, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I wonder what Dad would think of you...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="349">Hello.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="350">What do you want?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="351">Is farming fun to you? See, um...
I actually think it's kinda boring.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="352">Oh, that's a secret, though. Okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="353">&lt;playername&gt;, you aren't like my brother at all.
You're actually super nice.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="354">Rick just doesn't seem to get that I'm a grown-up now.
He never leaves me alone... I'll tell you more later.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="355">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;? What was the town you used
to live in like?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="356">I want to go traveling and visit aaall kinds of places.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="357">Y'know, &lt;playername&gt;, you're super mature
and impressive. I mean, you can run that whole farm
all by yourself.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="358">Rick was talking to me about how amazing you are.
I really look up to you too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="359">&lt;playername&gt;, what do you think of me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="360">Everyone here treats me like I'm still a little child.
Do YOU think I'm still a kid too?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="361">Awww! &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Wow... You actually treat me like I'm a real grown-up.
Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="362">I've always had a thing for the cool types...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But I'm coming around to the idea that quiet and mature
people like you can be preeetty awesome too. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="363">I've always had a thing for the cool types...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

  <Entry Index="364">Aah. It's always nice to be back in your own room.
Talk about relaxing.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="365">All of a sudden, I feel sleepy...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="366">I wonder what the point of the Church is.
Like, what's it supposed to be for?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Whenever I ask Father Carter about it, he only says,
"Good question."&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="367">The Church was built when I was still just a little girl.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'd always ask Rick to take me here to see it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="368">Right now, Mom is watching the store and Rick is
feeding the chickens.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="369">I'm sure Dad had a lot of faith in Rick. I mean, he didn't
teach ME how to do any of the chores the way he
taught Rick.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="370">I have a thing for beaches and the ocean in general,
but I think that out of all of them, I like Mineral Beach
the best.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="371">Kai's dad owns restaurants in lots of towns all over.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I betcha you didn't know that, huh?
I didn't for the longest time either.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="372">Summer is THE best season around!
I mean, isn't the ocean prettiest under the bright
summer sun?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="373">Have you ever eaten at the Beach Cafe? The menu
has all kinds of food you can't find growing here
in Mineral Town.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="374">The Spring Derby's coming up. Hmm, I've still gotta figure
out who I'm betting on...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="375">I wonder which horse is gonna win at the Derby
tomorrow...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="376">Whenever the Fetch Fest comes around, Kai just lights
up! He just loves, loves, LOVES the ocean!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="377">The Fetch Fest is tooomorrow! I'm super excited...but I've
gotta make sure I keep the sunburn to a minimum!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="378">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;! Are you entering a chicken in
the Cluck-Cluck Clash?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="379">We're pretty tied up with all the preparations for
tomorrow's Cluck-Cluck Clash.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="380">The Moo-Moo Festival is coming up! I can't wait to see
all the cute cows again this year!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="381">The prize-winning cow from the Moo-Moo Festival must
have super tasty milk, I'll bet!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="382">The Fireworks Festival is tomorrow! I don't wanna be
even a second late for it!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="383">It's Moonlight Night tomorrow. Staring at the moon
might sound kinda boring at first, but it's much more fun
than it sounds, promise!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="384">Why, hello there.
I don't believe we've met, have we?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Ohhh, yes, yes. Now I remember.
You must be &lt;playername&gt;.
Mayor Thomas told me aaall about you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
My name is Lillia.
It's so nice to meet you, sweetheart.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="386">My, my! And today is my birthday, too.
Why, thank you, sweetie.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
How old am I? Now, now.
You know a lady never tells. ♪&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="387">My, my! Why, thank you! My husband used to bring this to
me a lot in our younger days.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="388">Why, thank you, sweetie. I wonder, does Rick even know
what sorts of things his mother likes?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="389">Why, thank you, sweetie.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="390">Oh, dear. I'm afraid I don't like this...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="391">Goodness, gracious, great balls of grossness! I can't
believe you would try to give me something like that!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="392">Aww, you are such a sweetie pie.
There, there.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="393">Now, now! You mustn't bring anything like that here.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="394">My, my, my! Are you giving this to me?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Goodness, I haven't gotten something this nice in a long,
long time. Thank you so much, sweetie.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="395">Oh my, is this for me? Why, thank you, sweetie. You really
know how to please a lady.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="396">Some years ago, my husband decided he was going to get
me perfume for my birthday. He went to town to buy
some...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...but by the time he finally came back home again,
it was a whole year later on my next birthday.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="397">Ooh, I have a lovely idea. Why don't I teach you the recipe
for Tamagoyaki? It's really quite simple!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
First, you drizzle a little Oil in your Frying Pan.
Then, you crack the Egg in and cook it... That's it!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
They say you shouldn't eat more than one egg a day, but
I'm inclined to believe otherwise.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Eggs are tasty and packed full of nutrition, so get in that
kitchen and cook them up to your heart's content!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="398">Oh, what a lovely Blue Feather. Why, I still remember
the day my husband gave me one.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
He said he was going to find one for me instead
of buying it at a store... It was quite some time
before he came back.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="399">Do you remember the letter my husband sent to me
before? Well, he followed it up with another one.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
He said he was going to try to write to me more often.
I wonder where he is and what he's doing...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="400">Rumor says that in Forgotten Valley, they have little
rat-like creatures that people keep as pets.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Goodness, what were they called again? Ah, yes.
"Chihuahuas."&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="401">Everyone I've heard talk about them says they're cute
and friendly animals. I'd love to see one someday.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="402">I'm sorry, sweetie. I'm afraid that whenever I have to
rest, we close the store.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
After all, there's no telling if either of my children will be
home. I'm the only one who can mind the register.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="403">I haven't the energy to help take care of the chickens, so
I must make up for it by doing what I can in the store.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="404">I'm sorry, sweetie. I'm afraid we're closed today.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You see, I'm getting ready to go to my appointment at the
Clinic. I truly do apologize for the inconvenience.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="405">If you've come to buy Feed for your animals, did you know
that you can make it yourself?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

  <Entry Index="407">How is little &lt;childname&gt; doing?
They grow up so fast, don't they?
I'd love to come for a visit, if you'll have me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="408">Sasha always tells me there isn't another grandmother
in the world who looks the part quite like I do.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="409">How is Rick doing, sweetie?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
He's grown into such a responsible and serious young man.
He had little choice, what with my condition...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="410">How is my Popuri doing?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I brought her up as best I could despite my own
circumstances.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="413">Oh, hello there. How nice to see you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm afraid I don't have the strength to get out and about
all that much.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
That's why I hardly get to see you, &lt;playername&gt;.
It's a shame.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="415">My husband is out and about right now.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
He left to see if he could find medicine to cure my
condition.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Not that I particularly wanted him to leave. I don't need
a cure so much as I need him by my side.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="416">When we got married and went on our honeymoon,
my husband bought me two chickens as a present.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="417">Those chickens laid a huge number of eggs,
all of which hatched into more chickens than
we knew what to do with.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Soon, we had so many that we decided we might as well
start our own chicken farm.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="418">It feels so nice being outside.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="419">Oh my, what a coincidence! Hello, sweetie! And how is
&lt;childname&gt; doing, hm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="420">You know, I think I've been feeling a little better since
&lt;childname&gt; was born. My spirits are higher these

getting along? You two aren't fighting at all, are you?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="423">How am I feeling, you ask?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Well, I AM going to the Clinic for regular checkups,
but I'm afraid I'm still fairly lethargic these days.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="424">Oh! Why, hello, &lt;playername&gt;.
Are you feeling all right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="425">Oh! Why, hello, &lt;playername&gt;.

  <Entry Index="426">Medicine isn't very cheap, you know.
I feel ever so sorry that my poor children have to help
foot the bill.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Doctor always says I don't have to pay for my checkups,
but...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="427">Goodness, what ever shall I do to pass the time today?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

efforts that our chicken farm manages to stay afloat.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="431">Popuri still has a little growing up to do, but both she

Thanks to them, I can sleep soundly at night knowing that
our family will pull through--even in my husband's
absence.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

husband left to go on his trip.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I wonder...is he really out there trying to find medicine

No, no. I mustn't doubt him. I'm sure he will return home

&lt;playername&gt;. Will you be entering this year?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="443">It's hard to believe the Cluck-Cluck Clash is tomorrow...
Rick is a fine host for the event, but a mother always
worries... I hope he'll do all right.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="493">...Hey.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="494">Huh, so you just moved to that farm...
Hm? My name?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm Cliff.
Nice to meet you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="495">Thanks, &lt;nickname&gt;.
Oh yeah, today's my birthday, huh?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's nice to celebrate it with family.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="496">H-Huh? Are you sure?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Today's my birthday. I thought no one knew, so I'm a little
caught off-guard.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="497">Huh? For...me?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Wow, thanks. Today's my birthday, actually, so... Heh heh...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="498">Oh, you made that for me? Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I love your curry rice, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="499">Huh? You're giving that to me?
Nice of you to go to all that trouble.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Homemade foods are my favorite. ♪
Oh, except maybe buckwheat dumplings.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="500">Thanks. I knew I could count on you to remember what
I like, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="501">What? For me? You really outdid yourself with this,
honestly. I love it. Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="502">Oh, thanks!
You're...really nice.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="503">You're giving that to me?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Thanks, &lt;nickname&gt;. Even now that we're husband
and wife, you still treat me with such kindness.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="509">Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="510">What kind of message are you trying to send by giving
that to me?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I didn't think you were that kind of person,
&lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="511">What's this?
And what am I supposed to do with it?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="512">And this is?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="513">We live together, so if you have something to say,
just say it to my face, all right?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
What are you telling me to do with this?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="514">What're you trying to say?
Do you hate me, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="515">If you have something to say, just say it to my face.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="516">Oh, you like these too, &lt;nickname&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="517">Animals are the best.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
There was a mountain by the town I used to live in too.
I liked going there to catch bugs and watch the animals.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="518">Whoa whoa whoa!
Keep that away from me.
You're not scared, &lt;nickname&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="519">Whoa whoa whoa!
Keep that away from me!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="520">This photo! Where did you find it?!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="521">Oh... Huh. So you told Ran and the others.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The people in this picture are my mother and little sister.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="522">I...hated the town where I grew up, so I left. I ran away
and abandoned my mother and sister.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
When I came back, they were gone. My mother had
passed away, and my sister had disappeared.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It felt like I'd completely lost myself...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
So I wandered around on my own with nowhere to go
until I arrived here.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's...a lot like my hometown.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="523">Ah! Sorry! I'm sure you don't want to hear about all that.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Thank you...for finding this picture.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="524">Wow, that's some beautiful jewelry.
You're giving it to me?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Thanks! But I think it would look better on you,
&lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="525">Wow, that's some beautiful jewelry.
You're giving it to me?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I don't think I have much use for it, you know.
But thanks anyway!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="526">Wow, that's some beautiful jewelry.
You're giving it to me? Thanks!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="527">I think a gift like this is kind of wasted on me, but...thanks.
I'll take it.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I feel like you'd get more use out of it than I would,
though, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="528">For me? Thanks. I'll take it.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It may come in handy sometime.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="529">Wow... Thanks. I never thought I'd get something like this.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="530">Wow, that sure smells nice.
You're giving it to me?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Thanks. I think you'd enjoy it more than I would, though,
&lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="531">Wow. You're giving it to me?
Huh. I wonder if I can pull it off.
Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="532">Wow, that's something you don't see every day.
And you're giving it to me?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Thanks!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="533">Thanks, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But this is the day I'm supposed to give YOU something.
Did you mark the date down wrong on your calendar?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="534">Thanks. But today's when guys are supposed to be giving
out presents, and--&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Wait... Did I mess this up?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="535">Oh... What do I...?
Um... Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="536">Thanks. You didn't have to go to all the trouble of making
that just for me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="537">Huh? What's this? Valentine's Day?
You're giving that to me? Th-Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I don't think I gave you anything for White Day. S-Sorry.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="538">Thanks. It's kind of embarrassing to get something
in return.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="539">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;. Now that's something you don't
see every day.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Is that a Preserved Flower?
Y-Yeah...of course I know what it means.
We should go somewhere else, though.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="541">Uh... That's a Preserved Flower, isn't it? Probably not the
sort of thing you should be showing people so casually...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="542">A-Ah!
Um, hey, I feel kind of exposed right here, so...uh...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Let's go to your place, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="544">Oh, a Blue Feather! Now that I think about it, people use
those for proposals back in my hometown too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="545">Um... How to put this?
I'm glad you feel that way, but, uh... Sorry.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="546">What's the matter?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="547">Mention part-time job</Entry>
  <Entry Index="548">Remain pointedly silent</Entry>
  <Entry Index="549">Huh? A part-time job at the Vineyard?
Hmm, I AM almost out of money.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="550">Okay. I'll go check it out tomorrow.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="551">&lt;playername&gt;, tomorrow is Starlight Night.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm usually alone whenever the holiday rolls around,
so I thought maybe we could throw a party together.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Is it all right if we have it at your place?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

at 6:00 PM.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="555">No, no, don't worry about it. You can't help it if you
already have other plans. I get it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="556">&lt;nickname&gt;, tomorrow is Starlight Night.
Please be home around 6:00 PM.
I can't wait to celebrate together.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="557">We've finally started to build our own little family.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="558">I swear I just about fainted when I heard that you're
carrying a baby, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="559">We're parents now, &lt;nickname&gt;.
We'd better get it together.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="560">We're both dads now, &lt;nickname&gt;.
We'd better get it together.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="561">How are you feeling? What's it like having a baby
inside you?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's pretty much impossible for me to conceptualize,
because, well...you know.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="562">Your belly is getting bigger.
Is pregnancy as exhausting as it looks?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'll take care of grabbing anything you need from
the top shelf, so you just rest, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="563">Huh? The baby just kicked?
Let me feel it too!
The big day is around the corner, huh?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="564">I'm guessing that the baby could be born as soon as
tomorrow. We should have Doctor come over.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="565">Why don't you take it easy today?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="566">I'm a little scared to hold &lt;childname&gt;. I swear I've
had nightmares about not being able to support the
baby's neck.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="567">Raising kids is hard. When my sister was born, I was too
scared to hold her either. I should've just done it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="568">&lt;childname&gt; is getting bigger.
The human body truly is amazing.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="569">This is the first time since becoming an adult that
I've understood how my mom must've felt about
being a parent.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="570">&lt;childname&gt; is really becoming more and more
of a little person every day.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="571">Everything our baby does is just so adorable. I never
thought I would be such a doting dad, but here we are.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="572">Don't you think &lt;childname&gt; has sturdy standing
posture? I guess I must've had a knack for it growing up,
too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="573">Now that we have &lt;childname&gt;, I find myself
having gratitude for even the most mundane things.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="574">&lt;childname&gt; was trying to say something.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I want to talk back, but I'm not exactly fluent in baby.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="575">You seem to understand perfectly, &lt;nickname&gt;.
I'm a little jealous.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="576">...We haven't talked much recently.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="577">You think it's MY fault?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
What kind of husband and wife are we if we can't even
communicate on a basic level?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="578">You think it's MY fault?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
What kind of husbands are we if we can't even

  <Entry Index="579">...Morning.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="580">You're busy again today? Work is all well and good, but
don't forget to make some time for your husband, okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="581">Welcome back.
Are you done working yet?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="582">That was unkind of me.
I'm sorry...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="583">Morning, &lt;nickname&gt;.
How's the farm going?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="584">I'm doing well. You should come visit the Vineyard
once in a while.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="585">Work isn't all fun and games.
I'm sure you, of all people, know that well,
&lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="586">I'm not talking about myself. Something just struck me
while I was watching you work, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I couldn't help but think to myself that I still have a long
way to go.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="587">Morning. Is work going well?
Don't hurt yourself out there.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="588">Farm work has to be at least a little dangerous from
time to time, yeah?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="589">Welcome home, &lt;nickname&gt;.
Were you out working this late?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="590">I'm glad you're working hard,
but take it easy sometimes.
I'm worried about you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="591">Good morning, &lt;nickname&gt;! ∀
How're you feeling today?
I'm great.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="592">Good morning, &lt;nickname&gt;! ∀
How're you feeling today?
I'm great.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="593">It's nice to have someone to greet you in the morning and
welcome you back at night.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="594">My heart's at peace when I'm with you,
&lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

I'm so glad I married you, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="596">There really is nothing like being surrounded by family.
I'm so glad I married you, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="597">&lt;nickname&gt;! Listen, your body is in no shape to be
running around town like this. You do know that, right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="598">I'm glad you came to see me,
but please don't push yourself.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="599">Hey, &lt;nickname&gt;. You came to see me?
How's &lt;childname&gt; doing?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="600">Whenever I close my eyes, I can't help but picture
&lt;childname&gt;'s little face.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Like, is &lt;childname&gt; sleeping right now? Eating?
Crying? I'm obsessed.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="601">What is it?
Is something wrong?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="602">If you don't need me for anything,
then please don't talk to me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="603">Oh, &lt;nickname&gt;...
What's wrong?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="604">Huh? Me? ...It's nothing.
I just have something on my mind.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="605">Hey, &lt;nickname&gt;. Do you have business nearby?
It's weird to run into each other in town.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="606">I'm working hard at the Vineyard.
By the way, Manna's always saying that you should come
see her more often.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Apparently, she has a lot she wants to talk
with you about.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="607">Oh, &lt;nickname&gt;.
What're you doing here?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="608">You came to see me? Wow, that's really nice of you!
Makes me happy, honestly.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="609">Huh? &lt;nickname&gt;?
What's wrong?
Do you need something?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="610">Don't go back to the Inn by mistake? Haha. Don't worry.
I promise I'll come home to you tonight.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="611">Whenever I'm feeling worn down, Ran is always there
with refreshments. I really look forward to her stopping
by!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="612">I'm working hard!
I have to think positively!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="615">Manna and Duke are nice people, too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="616">I'm really grateful to Ran. From the moment we met,
she's treated me like a friend. Like...someone who
belongs here.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="617">Up until now, I've thought of Ran as something of a little
sister, but I'm beginning to see her in a new light.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

What's wrong?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="619">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;.
What's wrong?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="620">Never in my wildest dreams did I think I'd be getting
married so soon. It still doesn't feel real.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

I haven't decided on any course of action yet, though.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="626">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;.

  <Entry Index="627">I'm the same as always.
You know, something about this quiet town seems to
erase the passage of time.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="628">I go to the Church basically every day.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="629">Carter's an interesting guy.
He looks like a priest, but he doesn't act like one at all.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="645">Why am I still staying in a guest room? Hahaha, I actually
asked Dudley if I could.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

She's so nice, even to someone like me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

At the Inn, I mean!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

down here.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I know I feel better after resting someplace comfortable,

An Ancient Fossil and Pirate Treasure. I know where
ya can get the fish, but those last two? No clue.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

Heck, if you're up to the task, why not try puttin'
it together?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="825">Oh, are you allergic to metal, &lt;nickname&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
In that case, I'll take it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="826">It's beautiful.
...For me? Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="827">Did you buy that, &lt;nickname&gt;?
Hm? It's for me?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I...thought it was yours.
I'll take it, then. Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="828">Yes? What about it?
You're giving it to me?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'll take it, then. Perhaps I might have need of it someday.
Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="829">Smell is often linked to memory.
It's the body's olfactory response.
Incidentally, my mother often wore that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="830">Long ago, my mother often wore that.
Whenever my father would come back from town,
he'd bring that perfume for her.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="831">My, my. Today's White Day, is it not?
I like this, but what are you doing giving it to me,
&lt;nickname&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="832">My, my. I suppose today IS White Day.
Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="833">Thank you. I must say, you're a little offbeat to be giving
that to me today, of all days.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="834">Um... I...
No, thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="835">I suppose today IS the day for it, hm? Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="836">Thank you. So today's Valentine's Day.
I apologize for not giving you anything on White Day.
How neglectful of me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="837">Oh. A return gift for White Day, I see.
You didn't have to, but thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="838">Well, thank you. In return, let me teach you a simple
recipe for Mixed Juice using fruits and vegetables.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Oh, there's nothing around to write it down on. Well, just
try to remember it as best you can, hm?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Combine Fruit Juice and Veggie Juice in a Mixer.
That's it.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's a simple recipe, but very good for you. Give it a try.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="839">W-Wait a moment, I...
I'm not emotionally prepared.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
For the time being, let's go to your place,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="840">The Blue Feather...
Is it for someone I know?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="841">Oh... I never dreamed that you felt that way.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm grateful to be the object of your affection, but I'm
not quite there yet myself, I'm afraid.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="842">Do you know of Forgotten Valley?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I've heard rumors that a physician acquaintance of mine
lives around there.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
He has something of an...unusual appearance,
but his skills are top-rate.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="843">&lt;playername&gt;, are you aware that Starlight Night
is tomorrow?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I usually spend it with Carter, but I was wondering if you
might see fit to join us this year.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
With all three of us, it might be best to have a party
at your place, I reckon.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="844">I'll make some food for us to share, then. Come to the
Clinic after 6:00 PM tomorrow to fetch me.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Let's invite Carter and all go together.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="845">I see... You are no doubt busy enough without my meddling,
I'm sure. Don't trouble yourself over it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="846">Tomorrow is Starlight Night,
which means a party is in order.
We'll need to prepare a feast.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Make sure you come home tomorrow.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="847">We're finally going to be parents.
I couldn't be happier.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="848">You have nothing to worry about! I'll be with you
the whole way. It's times like these when I'm proud
to be a physician.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="849">Do you want to know if it's going to be a boy or a girl?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="850">I don't mind knowing, but there is more excitement to be
found in mystery, in my opinion. Let's hold off on it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="851">You've gotten much bigger.
Isn't it hard to work?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="852">Please don't push yourself too hard with your farm work.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm saying this not as your physician, but as your husband,
&lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="853">My, you've gotten big! The baby could come as early
as tomorrow. You should rest for today.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="854">It's all right. I'm right here, and I'll have Elly come, too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="855">I'm relieved that the delivery went smoothly.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="856">In my years as a physician, I've seen many a baby,
but watching my own child enter this world was
special indeed.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="857">&lt;childname&gt; is healthy and growing quickly.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="858">Our baby really takes after you, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="859">&lt;childname&gt; should start walking soon.
At least, based on the average timing
for this sort of thing.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="860">I dearly wish to see the exact moment &lt;childname&gt;
first stands on two feet. But if I'm at work,
well...so it goes.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="861">&lt;childname&gt; certainly is energetic.
You must have passed that trait along,
&lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="862">Children grow up much faster than we expect. Every day
is a gift, and every surprise is a blessing.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="863">Thank you, &lt;nickname&gt;.
I'm extremely grateful that our child was born healthy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="864">&lt;childname&gt; should start talking soon.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The future is still full of potential, but it's thanks to you
that I've found my one true source of happiness.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="865">Sorry.
I'm tired today.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="866">Please don't talk to me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="867">Good morning.
Hm? I seem upset?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="868">You're imagining things.
I'm simply a little tired.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="869">Welcome back.
You're late.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="870">Have you been busy recently? I feel like we haven't been
talking very much.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="871">Good morning, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="872">Come for an examination anytime you need it.
I wish I could waive the fee for my wife,
but protocol is protocol.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="873">Come for an examination anytime you need it.
I wish I could waive the fee for my husband,
but protocol is protocol.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="874">Welcome back, &lt;nickname&gt;.
How was your day?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="875">Me? I have the Clinic, after all.
I'm busy there. Obviously, I can't violate
my patients' privacy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="876">Good morning, &lt;nickname&gt;.
How are you feeling this morning?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="877">You're amazing, &lt;nickname&gt;. You never miss
breakfast. That's not true of many people these days.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="878">Welcome home. Do be mindful of your stamina when
you're working, all right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="879">If you aren't careful about using tools on rainy days,
you'll collapse. The human body needs food to burn
for fuel.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="880">Morning, &lt;nickname&gt;.
You seem as healthy and hearty as ever today.
Good health is something to celebrate.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="881">Let us each do our best today.
Many people would be in trouble if we didn't do our jobs.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="882">Welcome home, &lt;nickname&gt;.
Are you done working for today?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Make sure to get a good night's sleep...for your health's
sake, if not for your husband's. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="883">And should sleep elude you, at least supplement your
habits with nutritious food and the like.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="884">Hey, &lt;nickname&gt;. You should relax and take it easy.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Feel free to come here for a break whenever
you need to.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="885">Be extra careful when you go outside.
You mustn't trip and fall.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="886">How is &lt;childname&gt;?
Doing well?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="887">This is the most difficult period of child-rearing.
You should rest if you get weary, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
We're family, so don't hesitate to rely on me when
you're in need.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="888">Do you need something?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="889">Then leave!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="890">Oh, &lt;nickname&gt;. Is something the matter?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="891">If you have no business here, please leave. I'm working.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="892">Welcome, &lt;nickname&gt;. Did you come to see me?
Please, make yourself at home.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="893">Do try not to bother any of my patients
while you're here.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And some of these tools are dangerous, so I ask that
you refrain from carelessly touching them.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="894">Oh, if it isn't &lt;nickname&gt;.
Did you have some business nearby?
Please, make yourself at home.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="895">I'm putting forth my best effort!
For the townspeople, and also for you, &lt;nickname&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="896">Oh, &lt;nickname&gt;. Welcome.
Please, make yourself at home.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="897">I'm glad that you're still taking time out of your busy
schedule to come see me!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="898">I'm glad that you're still taking time out of your busy
schedule to come see me!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="899">I was just speaking with Elly about how much of a relief
it is that you're married now, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Hm? Why, you ask?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="900">When you live alone, no one would know if you had
collapsed or were out late at night. That's a precarious
position to be in.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="901">Elly may slip up occasionally, but she
is exceptionally grounded and kind.
She's the one holding me together.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="902">The Clinic will remain as it always was, so there is no
need for concern.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="903">Hello. How are you feeling?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="904">If you're unwell, come speak to me at any time.
I'll examine you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Though I'll have to charge you. The Clinic has to stay
afloat somehow, after all.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="905">Hello, &lt;playername&gt;. How is your health?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="906">Elly is a wonderful assistant.
She's incredibly helpful.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="907">*sigh* If only I were stronger...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="908">I've been a bit depressed recently about how powerless
I am as a physician. *sigh*&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="909">Elly is always worrying about me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="910">That's no state for a physician to be in. I need to step up.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="911">When Elly is with me, I feel as though I can accomplish
anything.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="912">Elly and I support one another, allowing each of us to
reach our full potential. That's what I think.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="913">If we have a child, I hope they become a physician.
Naturally, I'd like them to practice in this town.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="914">Speaking of children, Yu is rather mischievous and
troublesome. He likely only does it to get attention,
though.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="915">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;. I still find it difficult to believe
that we'll be getting married soon.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="916">My personality is rather...unique, after all. There is hardly
anyone who truly understands me.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You're the exception, &lt;playername&gt;.
I love you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="917">Oh, do you feel ill?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="918">No matter how trivial it may be, if something ails you,
please come see me about it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="919">Hm? Is everything all right? Is it an emergency?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="920">It may be my day off today, but please, feel free to see
me any time you feel under the weather.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="921">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;. How's the farm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="922">Rather than shipping all of your crops indiscriminately,
save some and use them to create healthy meals.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="923">Hello, &lt;playername&gt;. Are you well?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="924">Living alone means you'll need to pay extra attention to
your health.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="925">Hello, &lt;playername&gt;.
How are you feeling today?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="926">To be honest, I'm concerned about your nutritional intake,
since you're likely overworking yourself.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="927">Where do you get all your energy?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="928">You work hard enough to put even a physician like me
to shame.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I suppose strength and endurance exist for people like you
to utilize.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="929">Recently, I've been beside myself with concern over your
dietary habits, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="930">Since you live alone, I imagine you eat whatever is most
convenient. Hmmm. That is troubling, to say the least.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="931">Who am I to you, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="932">Being with you fills me with vitality and optimism.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I respect your ability to furnish people with a different
kind of health than the type I can give as a physician.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="933">Yes? Is something the matter?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="934">We should both be getting to bed soon. Sorry.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="935">Yes? Is something the matter?
Do you feel ill?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="936">If you have no business with me,
I would like to call it a day now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="937">Oh, did you come in search of something to read as well,
&lt;nickname&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You ought to read to our unborn child as well. If you feel
a kick, that means they're listening. ♪&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="938">Even if it's not read from a book, simply speaking
to a child in the womb can have positive effects.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="939">I wish there were picture books here as well.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="940">You don't think &lt;childname&gt; is ready for those?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
That isn't true. Simply exposing &lt;childname&gt; to
books could kindle a lifelong interest in literature.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="941">Do you need something from me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="942">I would like to read in peace.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="943">...&lt;nickname&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="944">Please refrain from speaking with me.
It prevents me from reading.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="945">Well, now. This is a coincidence. Did you come to read
as well, &lt;nickname&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="946">Am I the only one under the impression that this library
is built specifically for you?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="947">Have you benefited from the books in this collection
as well, &lt;nickname&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="948">I wish more townspeople would show an interest in
reading. I wonder why they don't?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="949">Hey, &lt;nickname&gt;. The Library certainly is just the
place to enjoy some peace and quiet.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="950">Perhaps I feel relaxed because you're here,
&lt;nickname&gt;. Family is a miraculous thing.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="951">I sometimes run into Basil on Mother's Hill.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
He's a very kind person who goes out of his way to teach
me about medicinal herbs.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="952">The books that Basil has authored are a wellspring
of knowledge.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="953">Oh, &lt;nickname&gt;. What's the matter?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You haven't forgotten that you're pregnant now,
have you?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="954">You move so deftly that I can't help but wonder.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="955">Oh, if it isn't my &lt;nickname&gt;.
How is &lt;childname&gt;? Don't neglect your parental
duties, now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="956">Some days, &lt;childname&gt; is already asleep by the
time I get home.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I must strive to finish my work earlier.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="957">&lt;nickname&gt;...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="958">Leave me alone!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="959">Oh, &lt;nickname&gt;. What is it?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="960">If you have no business with me, please leave me alone.
I am not in the mood to talk right now!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="961">Hey, &lt;nickname&gt;. What are you doing in a place
like this?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="962">Is the farm coming along well?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I have the Clinic to mind, so I cannot help you much, but
tell me if anything is wrong. We're married, after all!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="963">Oh, &lt;nickname&gt;. What a coincidence to meet
in a place like this.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="964">Hm? You came to see me? There's no need to worry.
I'll be right home, so please wait for me there.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="965">Hey, &lt;nickname&gt;.
Did you forget something somewhere?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="966">I'm lucky to be married to a woman like you,
&lt;nickname&gt;. I believe that from the bottom
of my heart.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="967">I'm lucky to be married to a man like you,
&lt;nickname&gt;. I believe that from the bottom
of my heart.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="968">On days when the Clinic is closed, I forage for medicinal
herbs on Mother's Hill.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I request shipments of herbs from Zack as well, but the
amount he gives me isn't nearly enough for my needs.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="969">If you stumble upon another place that has an abundance
of herbs, let me know.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="970">Oh, so you've both come.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
When our child is bigger, I'd like to come here together to
pray. I hope I can instill a love of worship in them.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="971">Whether they're a boy or girl, I'm positive that they will
take a liking to Carter.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="972">Oh, what's the matter?
How is &lt;childname&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="973">I see. Well, good health is what matters most.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Hm? Why am I not more concerned? Carter told me to
set aside my worries as long as I'm here.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="974">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;.
Did you come to see the venue?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="975">We'll be getting married here.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
How amusing it will be to see Carter actually acting like
a priest for once.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="976">Carter may be a tad...unconventional, but I trust him fully.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="977">Manna, on the other hand... A while back, I was discussing
something with her.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And the next day, every patient who came to see me
knew every detail of our conversation. I was at a loss.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="978">Ah, that's right. The Cooking Exhibition is coming up.
Do you suppose they take nutritional content into
account when choosing a theme?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="979">I wonder what kinds of dishes we can expect from
tomorrow's Cooking Exhibition... I'd love to try the
winning meal.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="980">With the Harvest Festival around the corner, I can't
help but wonder what kinds of ingredients everyone
will bring...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="981">I simply cannot wait for the Harvest Festival. We'll be
bringing ingredients and making a special meal together
as a community.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="982">Moonlight Night, hm? I'm certain it will be a splendid time.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="983">I may not look the type, but I always buy tickets for the
Autumn Derby and cheer the entrants on. It makes the
race even more enjoyable.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="984">Buying tickets for the Autumn Derby makes it all the
more fun. I rather enjoy it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="985">Welcome! What's your name? &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm Blueberry. It's nice to meet you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="986">Tea parties are the reason for the springtime season.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="987">You brought an invitation? Yay! Everyone, it's time to set
the table for a tea party!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="988">The whole gang isn't here yet. We can't start the tea
party without them.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="989">Now isn't the right time for a tea party.
Timing is important!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="990">Awww... We can't have a tea party here.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="991">Guess what? Today's my birthday!
Thank you for the present!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="992">Yaaay! Wheee! Thank you, thank you, thank you!
I love it to bits!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="993">Yaaay! Thank you! I like this lots!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="994">Thank you for the present.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="995">Um... I don't like this much.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="996">...Ah!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="997">Hiya, little buddy. It's lotsa fun doing my work.
If you need help, let me know. Okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="998">EEK! You surprised me!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="999">Oooooh! Sooo spaaarkly!
It's like a star in your hand.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1000">Oooh, thank you! Are you sure you don't mind giving me

  <Entry Index="1121">It's spring. Spring means tea parties.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1122">We, um...like having tea parties with our friends.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1123">Are you looking forward to the tea party,

&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1125">...Hmm.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1126">I like spring for two reasons:
one, it's warm. Two, tea parties.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1127">Tea parties are a good place to catch up with friends.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1128">I hope you come visit us even when spring is over.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1129">I'm not gloomy. I'm just shy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1145">OH MY GOURD! I-It isn't going to bite me, is it?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1146">Oooh, that looks interesting! How do you play with it?

  <Entry Index="1147">Mmm! Smells pretty.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1148">I've never seen a Blue Feather before!
Wonder what kind of bird it comes from.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1149">Spring means tea parties! Lots and lots of friends come
to our tea parties.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1150">Do you like tea parties, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1151">If we had a tea party every day, would you come every
day, too, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1152">In spring, I think about tea parties aaaall day.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1153">We only send invitations to our tea parties to our
bestest friends.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1154">A tea party has to have the right decorations, or else it
isn't a tea party.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1155">I wish it was spring all year round. Then it would be
nonstop tea parties!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1156">Hm? Oh! Welcome.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1157">Welcome. Wish I had something to do!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

I knew you would come!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1160">I don't like party poopers.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1161">Playing beats working any day!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1162">Ooh! Ooh! What should we play today?
I'm already getting tingly with excitement!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1163">I have the mostest fun ever when I play with you,
&lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1164">Awww! Boo. That's too bad.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1165">Okay! We'll start helping tomorrow!
I promise I'll work extra super hard!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1166">HALT! Who goes there? A sneaky so-and-so?!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Hmm...you don't LOOK like a sneaky so-and-so to me.
Your name is &lt;playername&gt;, huh? Gotcha.
Hi. I'm Plum.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1167">Wow, didja know today is my birthday?

  <Entry Index="1169">GROSS. I don't like this at all.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1170">Ooh, so mega cute!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1171">I-I-I'm not scared! I-I was just, um, a little startled!
That's all.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1172">Thanks. I'll take good care of it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1173">What a pretty feather! I almost feel like I'm not worthy
of looking at it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1174">In spring, we have tea parties.
That's just the way it is.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1175">We only send tea party invitations to our bestest friends.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1176">You like tea parties too, right, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1177">If it meant you would come visit, I'd have a tea party
every day!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1178">If some sneaky so-and-so were to interrupt one of our
tea parties, I'd really give 'em a piece of my mind!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1179">Personally, I'd rather have a tea party instead of going
to work.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1180">I'll use these muscles to stand guard for our tea party
and make sure nobody interrupts us!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1181">If spring lasted all year, we could have as many tea
parties as we wanted.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1182">I won't tolerate sneaky so-and-sos doing bad stuff around
here!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1183">Welcome.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1184">Don't worry, &lt;playername&gt;! If you're ever in danger,
I'll rescue you!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1185">&lt;playername&gt;! I knew you would be coming soon.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1186">Don't go anywhere with strangers, okay? Even if they
offer you candy!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1187">I'm good at jobs that need lotsa muscle.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1188">Next time you come by, maybe I could help out by being
your bodyguard, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1189">Don't worry, &lt;playername&gt;!
I'm here, so you're safe as safe can be.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1190">You don't wanna?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1191">Okay! I'll start tomorrow.
I'm gonna put my back into it!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1192">Hello. And you are?
Oh, your name is &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm Cherry. It's nice to meat--er, meet you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1193">How did you know today was my birthday?
Thank you so much!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1194">Yaaay, I really like these! Thank you lots and lots!
&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Oh, &lt;playername&gt;, didja know?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I hear that Kappa likes it when you give him Cucumbers.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But Kappa is weird and likes them RAW.
They're so much better cooked!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1195">EEEEEK! Stop! Stooop!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1196">Aaah! Scaaary!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1197">Ick. I don't like these. They make my tongue go numb,
and then I can't taste food right.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1198">Guess what, guess what? I know a yummy recipe for
Yam Dessert! Let me teach it to you as thanks!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Even Mr. Dudley at the Inn can't make Yam Dessert as
well as I can. It's the most popular sweet at our tea
parties.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Okay. Are you ready? Right, so, you need Yams, okay?
And Eggs, too. And don't forget the Butter!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You mix them aaall together in a Pot with a little dash of
this and that, and then you bake them in the Oven!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You don't have to add anything else to bring out the
yumminess. They're just naturally that good.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Why don't you try making them at home tonight?
They're the yummiest, yammiest yams in the whole wide
world!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1199">What a pretty feather. I don't think I have any recipes
that call for feathers, though...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

Not many people realize that, but it's true.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1238">HEY! I don't like this at all!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

&lt;playername&gt;, do YOU like tea parties?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1243">I'd make sure we had tea parties every day if it meant
you'd come, &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1244">I like tea parties because I get to eat aaall sorts of
yummy snacks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1245">Cherry makes all the tasty goodies for our tea parties.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1246">I wish it was spring all year long. Then we could have tea

  <Entry Index="1247">I'm hungry...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1249">Yaaay! &lt;playername&gt; is here!
Do you have any presents for me today?
Maybe something...delicious?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1250">You always seem to drop by right when I'm getting
hungry, &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

What's what mean?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1252">I can't work if I don't have energy.
I hafta eat to get energy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1257">Goodness me. A new face.
You're &lt;playername&gt;, hm? I'm Ellen.
It's a pleasure to meet you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1258">Oh, my legs?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I have an illness that makes my muscles weak, so I've been
chairbound for some time now. I'm just at that age.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1259">Oh, my stars and garters. Not that I've worn
garters for many years now! Ho ho!
A present for me?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

  <Entry Index="1260">Thank you kindly, sweetheart.
Do come visit me again, you hear?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1261">Thank you. I love it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1262">Thank you for going to all the trouble.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1263">Oh, yes... Erm, thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1264">Erm... Might I ask why you'd give this to me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1265">Dear me! How precious.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1266">Dear me. What a rambunctious little one.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1267">Heavens to betsy, it's marvelous!
I could have sworn Sai gave me something similar once...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Or perhaps my memory is simply going.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1268">My, you're giving this to an old maid like me?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
This certainly takes me back to my younger days.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1269">Oh, is that perfume? I didn't know you fancied fragrances
like that, dear.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Hm? It's for me?
Why, thank you. You're very kind.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1270">Oh, before you go, dear, I'd like to teach you how to make
a Sandwich. In lieu of a recipe, I'll just tell you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
First, use a Knife to slice the Bread and the other
ingredients you'll be adding.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Try using Cucumbers, Tomatoes, or Boiled Eggs.
Elly often makes sandwiches for Yu, you know.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1271">Gracious sakes, that takes me back.
A Blue Feather... It must be fifty years now since
I got mine.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1272">Did you know that there's another town beyond
Mother's Hill?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I have a friend who lives there, and we write letters
to each other.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Word is, there's a person about your age working
on a farm there too. Kids these days are so spry.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1273">Elly's been taking care of Yu for what feels like her
whole life. She's had it even harder since I fell ill.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1274">Doctor is very capable for a man his age, so Elly's been
keen on him for a while.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I always used to wonder if they would get married.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1275">Goodness, it's you, &lt;playername&gt;.
Welcome.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1276">How is &lt;childname&gt; doing?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If only these old legs of mine would cooperate, I could go
dote on the little one anytime I wanted.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1277">It's gotten warmer out. Like clockwork, Yu comes home
every day with another bug he's found in the dirt.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1278">This balmy weather sends me right to sleep, I tell you.
Maybe just a short nap...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1279">Great balls of fire, is it ever hot out! We don't get much
sun in the house, so it's cool in here, at least.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1280">If you work up a nasty sweat, you'd best take a bath
to wash it off, dear. Otherwise, you'll catch a cold.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1281">Autumn is the season of bountiful food and drink.
I, for one, always eat well this time of year.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1282">Whenever Doctor goes to gather medicinal herbs,
he brings mushrooms back for us as well.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1283">The snow's piling up outside, isn't it?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's like this every year. It's so cold that even on clear
days, the sun can't melt all the snow.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1284">The farm can be a lonely place during winter, can't it,
&lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I haven't seen your farm, but I'm sure your animals are
hankering for warmer weather. Sit tight until spring.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1285">Oh, erm...hello. Can I help you?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1286">Huh? You're greeting all your new neighbors, you say? Oh!
You must be the one who moved into that farm. I'm Jeff.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1287">What? This is for me? 
Oh, you shouldn't have.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm gobsmacked that you knew when my birthday was.
Thank you!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1288">Wow, thank you!
That's so thoughtful of you. I love it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1289">Thank you! What a nice gesture.
I like it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1290">How kind of you. Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1291">I'm afraid I'm not too fond of stuff like this, sorry to say.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1292">Huh... All right. I think I see what you're trying to say.
Guess I really left a bad impression on you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1293">Gosh, what a little cutie pie.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1294">Er, could you please keep that away from me?
I-I'm surprised you don't mind handling it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1295">What? This is for me? Why, thank you.
You shouldn't have.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1296">What? This is for me?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Oh, you shouldn't have. I think I'll give it to Sasha.
I'm sure she'll love it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1297">Wow, that really smells great.
Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1298">What? This is for me?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Why, thank you. Besides my family, you're the only one
who gets presents for me, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1299">What? This is for me?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Why, thank you. Besides my family, you're the only one
who gets presents for me, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1300">Huh. So, romance is in the air, eh? Well, I'm rooting for
you. Good luck finding that special someone.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1301">I hear that &lt;linkedfarmname&gt; raises some unusual crops,
including a flower that can talk. Can you imagine?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'd be sitting pretty if I had something that unique to sell
at my store.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1302">Y'know, I heard from Kazan--he's a friend of mine--that
apparently, there's a strange artist in Forgotten Valley.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
We're talking kooky enough to insist on making art
using only the human body. No tools at all.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1303">Kaz is good friends with this artist.
So much so that they even wear the same style of gloves.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1304">Do you need something?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1305">You want to work at Duke's Vineyard?
Oh, er...I see.
Now, just between you and me...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Duke was a real schoolyard bully as a kid. Didn't like him
much then; don't care for him much now, either.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1306">&lt;playername&gt;! Welcome, welcome.
How's the farm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1307">&lt;playername&gt;! Welcome, welcome.
How's the farm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1308">Aah, I wish I could go see little &lt;childname&gt;.
You know, come to think of it, I AM feeling
a little "sick"...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
*cough* Guess I'd better step out for a few
and visit &lt;childname&gt; until I feel better.
Nobody will mind, right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1309">Aah, finally! The day is over.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And yet tomorrow comes quickly on today's heels.
Distressingly quickly, really.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1310">Running the store isn't easy. I swear my bills are always
piling higher. And everyone is so slow to pay their tabs.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1311">I feel so sorry for Sasha. We both scraped and saved
when we were younger to open this store, and now...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1312">Hello there! Come to do some shopping?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Well, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I'm afraid
we're not open right now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1313">Aaah... There's nothing like relaxing at home.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1314">Hello there, &lt;playername&gt;.
Take your time and look around.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1315">Hello there, &lt;playername&gt;.
Take your time and look around.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1316">I'm grateful that you pay so promptly for your purchases,
&lt;playername&gt;. Like, REALLY grateful.
I mean it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1317">I'm grateful that you pay so promptly for your purchases,
&lt;playername&gt;. Like, REALLY grateful.
I mean it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1318">Erm, welcome. I'm afraid the only thing we have in stock
that might interest a farmer are seeds. I suggest you buy
plenty. As many as you can afford.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I-I'm serious. But, erm... You ought to choose which ones
very carefully. Yes. That's just smart shopping.&lt;wait&gt;

I-I'm serious. But, erm... You ought to choose which ones

  <Entry Index="1320">...Oh, hello. You must have it hard, what with all that
manual labor. Careful you keep your stress level in check.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1321">I suggest you make friends with as many people as you
can around here. It's a small town, after all.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Yes, it's definitely wise to be friendl-- Ooh, ow, ow. No.
It's all right. I'm fine.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1322">Hello there, &lt;playername&gt;.
How's the farm?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I've noticed that it's really starting to look the part
lately.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1323">Hello there, &lt;playername&gt;.
How's the farm?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I've noticed that it's really starting to look the part
lately.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1324">So are you, actually. The farm takes after the farmer...or
does the farmer take after the farm? Well, either way. &lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Seeing you working so hard gives me the courage to work
a little harder myself. Not that my job's as hard as yours.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1325">I'm getting ready to head over to the Church.
It's my favorite place in town.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1326">Oh, er... I'm on my way to the Clinic. See, my stomach has
been giving me no end of grief lately...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1327">I was just about to head over to Dudley's place. He's a
good man, that Dudley. I ask him for a lot of advice.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1328">I love how tranquil it is here.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1329">It's wonderfully soothing to both the body and the spirit.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1330">I'm afraid I'm not operating at 100% today.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1331">Though I must say, being here at the Clinic really dulls
the edge of my stress.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1332">I'm not fond of wine in the slightest. Not one bit.
I understand that a lot of folks have a taste for it,
but not me.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
All it takes is one sniff, and... *gag*&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1333">Here's what I don't get: Duke makes wine from the fruit
in his Vineyard and sells it to Dudley, right?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But then he goes to the Inn and pays to have a glass of
his wine back. I don't understand what he's thinking.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1334">I trust everyone in town. That's why I allow them to buy
things on a tab.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
To their credit--heh--everyone DOES pay for what they
purchase...eventually. Some folks just like to take their
time.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1335">Sasha always scolds me over my business practices, but
deep down, I'm sure she understands where I'm coming
from.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1336">Derby season already? Gosh, time sure flies. I'm looking
forward to it, though.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1337">I'm wondering who I should place my bets on for
tomorrow's Derby... Ugh, my stomach hurts just thinking
about it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1338">The Fetch Fest is pretty soon, huh? Every time it comes
around, it feels like summer's officially arrived.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1339">Watching the competition is fun, of course, but I'd love to
just relax and sunbathe, too...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1340">Are you taking part in the Concert?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Karen tells me she's going to be singing again this year.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1341">I've already got butterflies in my stomach for
tomorrow's Concert, and I'm not even in it! I hope
Karen's performance goes off without a hitch...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1342">The Fluffy Festival's coming up, and everybody seems so
excited for it. Myself included, of course!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1343">Tomorrow's the Fluffy Festival. I can't wait to find out
who our winner is this year.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

Wow! Thanks so much.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

I never expected to get a birthday present from you,

  <Entry Index="1351">I know it's my birthday and all, but are you SURE you
want to give me something this pricey? Talk about
sticker shock.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1352">Wow, is this really for me? No way!
I lucked out so much marrying you, &lt;nickname&gt;. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

I really like this kinda stuff.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1357">Wow, thanks. That was cool of you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1358">Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1359">Hey, uh, &lt;nickname&gt;? Let me tell you a little story
about what you're holding. It starts like this: I hate it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1360">Yeah...no. Hard pass.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1361">It's a no from me, bud. All yours.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1362">GAH. Uh, how about you save that for someone else
next time, huh?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1363">So cuuute. Did you come all this way just to show me?
Aww, thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1364">So...cute...!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

Thanks!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1375">Thanks. Say, um, do you mind if I wear this at the next
festival?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm sure everyone's going to be like,
"Whaaat?! Karen? Wearing perfume?"
But hey, it smells so beautiful!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1376">Wow, nice! I wonder if Rick would get mad if I told him I
got something this nice as a present from you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1377">Holy sticker shock! Now THAT looks pricey!
Are you sure you want to give it to me?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Awesome! Thanks! I'm SO going to show it off
to everyone.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1378">Thanks. But, uh, you know today's White Day, right?

  <Entry Index="1379">Thanks. Today's White Day, right?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Now that we're married, I can get presents on both
White Day and Valentine's Day. Score!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1380">What, this is for me?
Thanks. I appreciate it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1381">There's always one every year, isn't there? A girl who
gives me chocolates, I mean. Can't say I'm mad at it,
though.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1382">Ooh, you DID make some for me! Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1383">What, really? Are you sure? I mean, I didn't get YOU

Thanks. I'll savor every bite.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1384">Wow, cool! Thanks!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
So you DID remember that I got you something for
Valentine's Day. Thanks. These look delicious.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1385">Oh, hey, &lt;playername&gt;.
What's that you've got there?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
A-Am I three sheets to the wind, or is that a Preserved
Flower? Okay. Yeah. We need to talk about this
somewhere else.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

somewhere else.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1387">Nice Preserved Flower you've got there. You'd better
put it somewhere safe before you lose it, though.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1388">Wha-- But-- I-- ...Deep breaths, Karen.
Uh, can we go to your place to talk this over?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1389">Wha-- But-- I-- ...Deep breaths, Karen.

I'm totally rooting for you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1391">Huh? A Blue Feather? Yeah, I know what it means.
I...I just don't think I'm ready to take that leap yet.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1392">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;! You know tomorrow's
Starlight Night, right?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
My family's going to be throwing a party.
You can come too, if you want.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1393">You will? Cool. We'll keep a seat warm for you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1394">Really? Aww, that stinks. Well, if you can't come,
you can't come. That's fine.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1395">Tomorrow's Starlight Night, so make sure to be home
by 6:00 PM, okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1396">Man, I had no clue I was pregnant.
One day I'm hanging out, doing Karen things,
and the next? Boom. Baby incoming.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1397">Now that I think about it, it's no wonder I've felt so gross
every morning lately. Guess that's pregnancy. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1398">Y'know, it still hasn't really sunk in that I'm pregnant.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I still feel pretty nasty in the mornings, though. That part
I can guarantee is 100% real.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1399">The other day, Mom told me I'd changed. She said I look
like a mother now. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1400">Phew... Even just walking around is getting really
tiring now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1401">Any day now, baby... Come on out and stop making your
mommy's back hurt so much. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1402">It looks like tomorrow's going to be the big day. Elly and
Doctor have already said they'll be here for us.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1403">You'll hang around here tomorrow too, right,
&lt;nickname&gt;? And I'd be really happy if you came
home early today. ∀ &lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1405">Ugh, this kid of ours sure has a strong set of pipes.
The crying never stops. I'm so sleep deprived,

  <Entry Index="1410">*sigh* Morning. Nobody told me raising kids

  <Entry Index="1412">Morning. It always surprises me just how darn FAST
kids grow.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I used to get so nervous and excited every time our baby

  <Entry Index="1414">Sorry. I'm not in the mood to talk now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1415">Just leave me alone, would you? Geez.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1416">Morning. Okay, what's first on the agenda today?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1417">I've never been a big morning person.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1418">Ugh. Trying to think of something to cook for supper
every day is so darn exhausting.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1419">Oh, spare me the worried look, please.
I'll come up with something.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1420">Morning. Another day, another opportunity to knock our
chores down flat on their chore-butts.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

You ARE a teeny bit better at cooking than I am...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1424">Morning. Hee hee. You were sleeping so soundly all night.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1425">Y'know, sharing a living space with so many animals is
actually pretty fun.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1426">Lately, even meal planning for the family isn't the slog it
used to be.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1427">Actually making it is even more fun, of course.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1428">Morning, &lt;nickname&gt;. ∀&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Aah... What a beautiful morning.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1448">Not interested in getting married, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'd think having a partner there to help would make your
farm work a lot easier, at the very least.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1449">Y'know, I get so worried for the chickens when it's rainy
out.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

He can be reeeal gung-ho sometimes, but I'm betting
that translates to things being a lot easier for you
on the farm.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1455">Y'know, I'm glad you have some family here now,

a whole lot.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Well, okay. It's more Mom chewing Dad out than
an actual two-sided argument.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

track of time like this has become a bad habit of mine.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1561">Oh, hello, &lt;playername&gt;.
Fancy meeting you here.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1562">Poor old Mugi only has little Mei to help him run
Yodel Ranch. Life isn't easy for them, I'm sure.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If you have a chance, why don't you swing on by and see
if you can't lend them a hand with this or that, hm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1563">Oh, hello, &lt;playername&gt;. Sunny weather makes for
a sunny disposition, wouldn't you say?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1564">Are you learning a lot from Mugi? He's such a kind and
helpful old gentleman.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
He's been sweet to me ever since I was a little girl. I still
remember how he let me trot around on his horse.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1565">Lillia has always been frail, the poor thing. Back when
Doctor's father first came to town, he examined her...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...and he made it very clear that an active lifestyle was
just not in the cards for her. A shame, hm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1566">Now, Lillia and I have been best friends for ages.
When I heard her prognosis, I nearly fainted,
but she just smiled.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1567">I told myself, right then and there, that I would have
to do all the things that she couldn't. For her sake.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1568">Lillia's husband is a good man, but when an idea
gets into his head, he becomes fixated on it.
Where HAS he gotten to?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1569">Goodness! He really ought to come back home--and soon.
Poor Lillia has been left waiting and waiting...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1570">I like to spend my afternoons catching up with Ellen.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Her granddaughter, Elly, is such a sweet girl. Talk about
someone with her head screwed on good and tight.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1571">Karen's a natural-born caretaker, but the trade-off is
that she often forgets to take care of herself.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1572">Yu is such a rambunctious little troublemaker. He sure
enjoys his pranks. Poor Ellen has a hard time keeping up.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1573">Well, I suppose that's better than him staying cooped up
in his room all day. Getting out and about is good for kids.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1574">Oh, really?! Mhm...
Mhm... And then...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1575">Ahahaha! You don't say?
Mhm... And...did?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But are you sure it... 
The...instead?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1576">Well, hello! How fares the farm?
All is going well, I hope?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
We're lucky to have Karen here to lean on when it comes
to the store. And what a big help she is!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1577">My husband can't seem to stop letting customers make
their purchases on a tab. I swear, we're not a soup
kitchen...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Still, his inclination to be so kind and trusting is one of
many reasons why I fell in love with him.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1578">Will you be participating in the Derby this season,
&lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1579">Jeff insists he'll get me a gift with all his medals
this year.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If he were to win, though, I'm not sure if he
actually would...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1580">I wonder what kind of theme they'll choose for this
year's Cooking Exhibition...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1581">Tomorrow's the Cooking Exhibition, but I can't help but
worry about what Karen will...create. I do hope she'll be
all right...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1582">I'm looking forward to the upcoming Fetch Fest, but the
summer heat? Not so much...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1583">The animals that take part in the Fetch Fest always
work so hard out there! It's just adorable!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1584">The Concert's in a few days... Will you be playing
something, &lt;playername&gt;?</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1585">Karen's going to be singing tomorrow. I can't wait to
hear her performance!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1586">Making a delicious communal meal with everyone's
ingredients is the heart and soul behind the
Harvest Festival.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1587">The best part of the Harvest Festival is finding out what
we'll be able to make from our ingredients! I wonder
what we'll have this year...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1588">It's so lovely to be able to ring in the new year with
everyone. And we'll have lots of soba noodles to look
forward to afterwards!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1589">Oh, I haven't seen you around before.
You say you moved into that farm?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm Dudley, and I run our town's Inn.
Good to meet you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1590">Whoa, wait a sec.
This is a little embarrassing.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I didn't expect a birthday present from anyone other
than Ran.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1591">Hey, thanks! I love it. Seriously.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1592">Thanks. Sorry to put you out like this.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1593">Hey, I'll take it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1594">Now you've put me on the spot.
Well...I guess since you're offering...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1595">Hold on, back it up. What exactly do you expect me to do
with this?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1596">Hahaha! Adorable.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1597">Even I have animals I don't like.
Congrats. You found one that fits the description.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1598">What, you're giving this to me?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You know, if you want to give a gift to Ran, you don't
have to go through me. Be more assertive, y'know?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1599">I think I gave something similar to Ran's mother once
upon a time.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Thanks. I'll pass it along to Ran.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1600">Perfume, huh? I think I gave that to HER as a gift once
upon a time.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Guess I'll give it to Ran. Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1601">Oh, now that I think of it, today IS Valentine's Day, huh?
Thanks, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1602">Oh, hey, let me teach you how to make Cheese Fondue.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Do you know what that is? I'll tell you the recipe right
now, so clear some space out in that noggin, eh?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The main ingredient is Cheese, and then you need Bread
or veggies. I'd wager that Eggplants or Carrots are best.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
All you need to make it is a Pot. Whaddaya think?
Pretty easy, right? Try it once and you'll be hooked.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1603">Oh, so you got your hands on a Blue Feather, huh?
You need that to propose. Well, good luck.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1604">You know Bon Vivant, the guy who acts as the judge
for our Cooking Exhibition?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Turns out he's pretty famous in the food biz. He travels
the whole world looking for new things to eat.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1605">Apparently, a guy named Griffin runs a bar
in Forgotten Valley.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Word is, he's come to Mineral Town at least once
or twice.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1606">Griffin used to be a famous musician way back when.
He toured around the world.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I even went to see one of his concerts with Ran's mother,
if you can believe it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1607">Welcome. Ah, it's you, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1608">How's &lt;childname&gt; doing?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'll be sure to buy a ton of toys before I come over next.
I can't wait to see that cute little smile.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1609">How's Ran doing?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1610">As long as she isn't causing you any trouble...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1611">...Then I have nothing to worry about.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1612">Cliff is a real stand-up guy.
He promises he'll stay here forever.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1613">I wonder if she's happy up in heaven, too...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1614">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;. What's up?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1615">As you can see, we're already closed for the day.
I'll be heading to bed shortly.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1616">Hey. How're things going?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1617">Well, take it easy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1618">Hey, nice to see you, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1619">Let's get some calories in you so you have the energy
to keep working hard, eh?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1620">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;.
Here to unwind a little?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1621">We're in business all year round, so there's no time
for me to rest. Such is the curse of being an innkeeper.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1622">Hey, what d'you want at this time of day?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1623">Come back when we're open.
Ugh, I'm bushed.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1624">I'm cooking right now. Mind taking a few steps back?
Wouldn't want you to get burned or something.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1625">I'm busy, pal. Wait out front. If you want something,
I'll take your order later.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1626">Hey...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1627">Ran's taking care of the Inn. I admit I'm worried about
her being on her own.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1628">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;...
A year passes by so quickly.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1629">Is there anyone you'd give the world to see just one more
time, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1630">Dunno what I'd do without Ran. It's more or less thanks
to her that this place is still up and running.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1631">Working hard, eating well, drinking plenty, and getting
a good night's sleep... There's nothing better.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1632">I'm sure you're as excited about tomorrow's
Mochi Bonanza as everyone else, but just
be careful you don't overeat.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1633">Another Spring Derby's coming along, eh? I wonder what
sorts of horses we'll get to see compete this year...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1634">You gonna be entering in tomorrow's Derby,
&lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...Either way, I gotta buy me some tickets.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1635">Will you be entering the Cooking Exhibition, too,
&lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Well, either way, I can't afford to be so easily beaten.
I've got a name to uphold, after all!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1636">Now, what's the theme gonna be for tomorrow's
Cooking Exhibition...?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1637">I'm on the lookout for a good chicken at the Cluck-Cluck
Clash. I'm sure the chickens there must lay high-quality
eggs...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1638">So, how about tomorrow's Cluck-Cluck Clash,
&lt;playername&gt;? You gonna enter one of your birds?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1639">Hmm... I've gotta bring the best-quality ingredient we've
got for the Harvest Festival.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1640">It's a real treat to see what kind of meal the town can
cook up together at the Harvest Festival. I can't wait
for this year's.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1641">Well, it's Autumn Derby time once again. I'm sure there'll
be some fine horses racing this season.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1642">Oh yeah, are you racing in the Derby, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Either way, I've gotta get me some tickets.
It's much more fun to watch that way.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1643">Tomorrow marks the end of another year.
You'll be coming to the New Year's Party,
won't you, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1644">Hm? Sorry, who are you?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Ohhh, you're the girl who took over that farm. I thought
for sure you were a guest. What's your name?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
That's pronounced, uh... "&lt;playername&gt;," you said?
I'm Ran! Nice to meet you!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1645">Hm? Sorry, who are you?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Ohhh, you're the guy who took over that farm. I thought

That's pronounced, uh... "&lt;playername&gt;," you said?
I'm Ran! Nice to meet you!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1646">A birthday present? For me?
Awww... I'm super happy. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1647">Whoa, is that a birthday present?
Eee! I'm so happy!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1648">&lt;nickname&gt;... Thanks. I'm totally, utterly...
Tickled piiink! Wooo!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1649">Huh? A birthday present? For me?
Wow, thanks! It's wonderful!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1650">Thanks. Getting such an amazing present has made this
the best birthday EVER.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1651">You're so thoughtful, &lt;nickname&gt;.
I love you. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1652">Whoa! Heeeck yeah!
Can I really have this? Thanks!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1653">Aw, thanks! I always look forward to seeing what you
bring me every day!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1654">Huh? You're giving this to me?
Yaaay! I love it! Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1655">Yay, a souvenir! ∀
Thanks, &lt;nickname&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1656">Thanks! This is awesome!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1657">Thanks!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1658">Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1659">What? I shouldn't be picky?
But... Well, I guess you're right.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1660">Wait, you're giving this to me, not just showing it to me?
Um... Thanks, I guess?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1661">Ugh! You should know better than to bring something like
that to me on purpose!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1662">Just because I like to clean doesn't mean you should
bring me trash! Throw it away yourself!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1663">Awww, so cute!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1664">Eee! It's so cute!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1665">Eek! &lt;nickname&gt;, you meanie!
You're the worst!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1666">Whoa! That about gave me a heart attack!
Quit messing with me!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1667">Waitwaitwait...what? For ME?
No way! Thanks so much!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1668">Whoa, can I really have this?
Yeah? Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...You SURE you're sure?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1669">Whoooa! That looks so expensive.
You're really giving it to me?
Th-Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1670">I love it.
Thanks, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1671">Wow, you're giving this to me?
Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1672">Th-This is for me?
Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1673">Huh? Perfume?
*sniff* Smells nice.
Like...happiness in a bottle.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1674">Huh? You sure?
Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1675">Uh, I'm not exactly sure I'm a sophisticated enough girl
to be wearing perfume...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1676">Huh? You think I am?
Well, thanks. I'll treasure it, then.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1677">Huh? You're giving this to me?
Thanks. Hey, wait...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1678">Isn't today White Day?
Can I...really have this?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1679">Thanks. I'm seriously blushing here.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I never thought I'd get chocolates from a girl.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1680">Thanks. I'm seriously blushing here.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I never thought I'd get chocolates from a guy on
Valentine's Day.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1681">Wow, that looks GREAT!
White Day is the best holiday ever.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Yeaaah, I think this beats the pants off of the ones
I made.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1682">Whoa, cookies!
Wait, is this for White Day?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Now I feel bad that I didn't give you anything
on Valentine's Day. I will this year. Promise.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1683">Th-Thanks. But you don't have to give me something just
because I gave something to you, y'know?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1684">You look like you're doing well, &lt;playername&gt;.
Don't overwork yourself on that farm.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1685">You look like you're doing well, &lt;playername&gt;.
Don't overwork yourself on that farm.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1686">Huh? A P-Preserved Flower? Um... Right.
Sidebar at your house, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1687">That's a Preserved Flower, right?
Neat. Who're you giving that to?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1688">Oh! &lt;playername&gt;...
A-Anyway, let's go to your house.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1689">Oh! &lt;playername&gt;...
A-Anyway, let's go to your house.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1690">Awesome! Congratulations.
You'd better get going.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm sure your special someone is waiting for you,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1691">Awesome! Congratulations.

I'm sure your special someone is waiting for you,

  <Entry Index="1692">A Blue Feather? Hmmm, I think it's a little early in our
relationship for me to be accepting that...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1693">Let's have dinner together tomorrow for Starlight
Night! I'll handle the cooking, so grab a bib
and come hungry!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1694">Really? You'll come?
All right! I'll be waiting!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1695">Awww. Well, if you've got other plans, there's not much
you can do about that. I understand.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1696">I'm gonna make a feast for Starlight Night tomorrow.
Dinner should be on the table around 6:00 PM.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

It's real simple. You just need to get your hands on
some Wild Grapes, and... Oh, what was it? Ah, yes!

Stick both of those in a Pot, say the magic words,

I'll try giving it to her. Thanks for the tip.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1871">Thanks. I'll try giving it to Anna.
I'm sure she'll love it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1872">This has a nice scent.
I can tell it's all-natural, too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1873">Hey, thanks. I got some from Anna first thing this
morning, too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1874">Oh, that's right.
Do you grow any fruit on your farm?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'll teach you how to make a Fruit Smoothie, so get your
pen and paper ready.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
All you need is Fruit Juice and Milk! You simply put those
two in a Mixer, and voilà: Fruit Smoothie.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Huh? You want to know how to make Fruit Juice?
I'm afraid that's beyond the realm of my expertise.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1875">Ah... What a fascinating local custom.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1876">I heard there's a plant in Forgotten Valley named Tartan
that can selectively breed other plants.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It was apparently created when some scientist
experimented with fusing plant and animal genes.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1877">I'd like to go see it once.
Wouldn't you as well?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1878">Is there anything you want to ask me? If it's within my
realm of knowledge, I'll gladly educate you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1879">Oh, that so? Well, despite appearances, I'm actually
working even as we speak.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Sorry I can't be of more help.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1880">Delightful weather we're having!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1881">Humans and plants aren't so different.
Both exhibit depressive symptoms when they're not
exposed to enough sunlight.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1882">Plants have a sort of sixth sense, you know.
They can sense human emotions.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm currently writing a book on that very subject.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1887">I can't wait to bring &lt;childname&gt; to the mountain.
Don't you think that'll make for a great learning
experience?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1888">Mother's Hill is home to a considerable variety of plants.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Incidentally, that biological diversity is precisely why we
came to this town.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1889">There are many plants that only grow here in this town
and nowhere else.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1893">The weather is gorgeous today!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1894">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;. Are you done working?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

  <Entry Index="1897">Plants change so much in just a week's time.
That's especially true for when it rains or snows.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1898">Today's my favorite day of the week, bar none!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1899">They say that if you do what you love, you'll never work

Oh cruel, cruel world...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

&lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'd like to go see them sometime.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1908">Plants need an appropriate amount of water and
fertilizer.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Tend to them once a day, and you'll be in botanical
business. Don't let the poor things go thirsty, hm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1909">What kinds of crops are you cultivating these days,
&lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If you have the chance, I'd love it if you could show me
sometime!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

My name is Marie.
It's nice to meet you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1927">This is for cooking, right?
I ask because I don't eat this.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1928">Mmm... I don't know what to say.
I'm not especially fond of that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1929">Ah, I...I'd rather not accept that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1934">...Ah!
*staaare*&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1935">Thank you. This is made from the spoils of one of your
mining trips, right, &lt;nickname&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Knowing that you had a hand in creating it makes me
even happier.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1936">Oh, for me?
Are you sure?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
This is an accessory that Gray's grandfather made,
correct?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I wonder if Gray will make one for me someday.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1937">Thank you.
Hmm...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
This accessory really piques my interest. I've never seen
this stone before.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1938">Thank you! I can't imagine how costly this must have

Well, th-thank you anyway. I'll happily accept it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

I'll happily accept it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1949">Wow, thank you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I didn't give you anything on Valentine's Day, did I?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'll have to rectify that next year.

  <Entry Index="2040">This town feels like a quaint fairy tale hamlet nestled in
the countryside.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2041">Hello.
Are you enjoying your life on the farm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2042">Would you tell me all about what a farmer does
sometime?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You came all the way to this town only to undertake a
life of hard labor... I imagine I could learn a lot from you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2043">Oh, hello there! Your voracious appetite
for the written word is admirable.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2044">I love the scent of books.
They smell like...a forest, almost.
It transports me to a place of calm.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2045">Oh... Hello.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2046">Ah, no, I was simply lost in thought. I notice that only
certain people ever come to the Library.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And yet I dearly want to foster a passion for reading in
all of Mineral Town's residents.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2047">Oh, hello there.
You're starting to be a familiar face!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2048">I want to keep working here, even if I get married.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
As long as people come to the Library, I want to be here
to greet them.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2049">Hello... Rrrgh.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2050">What is wrong with me? I can't explain this strange
feeling welling up inside my chest.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2051">Oh, hello, &lt;playername&gt;.
The Library is closed on Thursdays, just so you know.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2052">I like to climb to the top of Mother's Hill on sunny
afternoons.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Saibara comes here in the morning, too, but I guess Gray
doesn't like to tag along.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2053">On Thursdays when the weather is bad, we go to Gray's
grandfather's place instead.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2054">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;.
What's the matter?
Do you need something from Gray?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2055">You're always doing so much for Gray. Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2056">Oh, hello, &lt;playername&gt;.
The Library is closed today.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2057">Once a week on Mondays, we hike up to Mother's Hill
as a family so I can help my Papa.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2058">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;. You won't find me
on the mountain in this kind of weather, but
I'm afraid the Library is still closed.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2059">I mean, even if I opened it, no one would
come anyway.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2060">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;. What's the matter?
Is there a book you'd like to read?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2061">The Library is usually open from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM.
I look forward to seeing you the next time you come by.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2062">Good morning.
It's the start of a beautiful new day.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2063">Are you enjoying life on the farm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2064">Oh, hello.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2065">Try not to catch a cold, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2066">Hello. I'm afraid it's that dreadful day of the week when
the Library is closed: Thursday. I know, I know. Sorry.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2067">The Library is closed today.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2068">Once a week, we come to Mother's Hill as a family
so we can help my Papa.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2069">Hello. The Library is closed today, I'm afraid.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2070">Oh, what a coincidence.
I'm running errands for Mama today.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2071">Mama always buys too much. My arms aren't cut out
to carry it all home.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2072">Oh, if it isn't &lt;playername&gt;.
Are you on a botanical survey as well?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2073">Papa brings me and Mama out to the mountain even
in the winter.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm grateful that he can dig deep within and find some
discretion when it's snowing outside, at least.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2074">Oh, hello. Coming to the mountain with Gray makes for a
much more enjoyable outing than my trips with Papa. &lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2075">When I come with Papa, we're so fixated on what's
growing out of the ground that we neglect to appreciate
the scenery.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2076">A blacksmith's job is very difficult. I can't imagine
handling fire every day. The mere thought gets my heart
pounding.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2077">I enjoy visiting Gray's grandfather.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
My parents can be a little absent-minded, so I'm jealous
of Gray's comparatively down-to-earth family.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2078">Ah, that's right! The Moo-Moo Festival is in just a few
days, isn't it? There'll be cows a-plenty there!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2079">Tomorrow's Moo-Moo Festival is sure to be a good time!
Perhaps the winning cow will even inspire a story out of
me...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2080">I do hope you'll join us at the Concert. We have such fun
every year.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2081">Goodness, the Concert's tomorrow! I hope I'll be able to
play well enough...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2082">The Fireworks Festival is tomorrow. It's quite a lovely
sight to behold. It really does stir the heart.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2083">Oh, I wonder what I should take with me to the
Harvest Festival...?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I've got to take something truly appetizing.
I want to make sure my ingredient counts!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2084">The Harvest Festival meal incorporates ingredients of all
kinds... Unfortunately, that doesn't necessarily mean the
final product will be a five-star meal.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2085">Will you be headed to tomorrow's Moonlight Night,
&lt;playername&gt;? I personally can't wait to go
moon gazing.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2086">Do you have a horse in this Derby, &lt;playername&gt;?</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2087">Tomorrow's the Derby, is it? I've been debating over
whether to buy tickets or not...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2088">What a year it's been... I hope you'll join us at the
countdown tomorrow.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2089">May I tell you about a rumor I've heard?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Supposedly, there's a book out there that engrosses its
readers so much, they lose all sense of time!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If a book like that really does exist, I'd love to read it,
even just once...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2090">I've heard another rumor regarding that time-consuming
book, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Apparently, it can suddenly appear on your bookshelf
while you're not looking. Mysterious, isn't it?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2091">I've heard yet another rumor, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Do you remember that mysterious book I was telling you
about? It's not the only one--there are several types,
apparently! I wonder what genres they are...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2092">Hello there. Goodness, we haven't met before, have we?
...Ah, so you're the one who just moved into that farm?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Speaking of which, I seem to recall Thomas mentioning
something along those lines.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
My name is Anna. I hope you'll come to enjoy life
in our cozy little town.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2093">Hm? Are you quite sure?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Usually, it's only my family that celebrates my birthday.
Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2094">Thank you! I'm absolutely delighted.
You make gift-giving an art form.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2095">Oh, my! What a considerate gift.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2096">Thank you. I'm rather fond of this.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2097">Hmmm. I...don't particularly like this. But since you're
offering, I suppose it would be rude not to take it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2098">Absolutely NOT.
What is the meaning of this?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2099">Aw. How cute. Basil is always going on about how plants
are "cute" too, but I can't say I see it the way he does.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2100">Why would you show me such a thing?!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2101">My, this is just lovely. What brand is it?
...It doesn't have a brand, you say?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The...blacksmith made it?
Then it's Saibara-brand, isn't it?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2102">Oh, my. Thank you. It's funny--I was just thinking about
how much I wanted something like this.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You truly understand what women want, unlike a certain
husband of mine.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2103">Oh, what a lovely fragrance. I hear this is all the rage
with the youth lately. Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2104">My, my. A bona fide Blue Feather.
I wish I'D been proposed to with one.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2105">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;. How is &lt;childname&gt;?
I can't wait to visit.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2106">That Basil, I swear. His enthusiasm for taking
&lt;childname&gt; to the mountain couldn't have a
clearer agenda.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
He's determined to make our grandchild into a botanist.
"Plant a seed and see what grows," they say...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2107">Hello, &lt;playername&gt;. Have you had a chance to read
any of Basil's books?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The Library is positively overflowing with texts
he's written.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2108">Market trends favor town guides over specialized books
like Basil's botanical encyclopedias.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
That fact gives him no small amount of grief. His books
may be helpful to you, though, so give them a read.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2109">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;! A long-lost memory just came
back to me.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Once, when we went to the mountain, Basil was so
absorbed in looking at flowers that he fell off a cliff.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Isn't that simply hysterical?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2110">My husband is always sneaking off to the Inn for evening
libations. Bit of a freewheeling sort of man, isn't he?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2111">Oh, my. Good morning, &lt;playername&gt;. Hard at work
again today? I can't imagine how exhausting your
schedule must be.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2112">Honestly, I'm a little envious of you, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
My circumstances are so dull that I spend every morning
thinking about how I'm going to spend yet another day.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2113">My, my. It's coming down hard today.
Poor Basil's probably feeling sullen.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2114">Yesterday, I prayed that we'd have good weather today.
But when I woke up, well...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2115">My prayer must have backfired somehow.
Talk about strange. Oh, but don't breathe
a word of this to Basil, okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2116">What should I do when I get home? Even if Basil ends up
being around, he'll no doubt be focused on work.
What a bore.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2117">In the afternoon, all the wives in town gather at the
Plaza to gossip about this and that.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I truly look forward to catching up with everyone. Basil,
on the other hand... He only talks about plants. *sigh*&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2118">Oh! Hello, &lt;playername&gt;. It's good to see that you're
doing well.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2119">Today's my weekly shopping day. I always look forward
to seeing what the General Store has in stock.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2120">Pots are an absolute necessity for cooking,
so I recommend buying one.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2121">Sasha's husband always seems so exhausted, yet Sasha
herself is completely unflappable.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I imagine it's hard work running a business.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2122">And I certainly do NOT have a tab here. I simply forget
my wallet on occasion.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2123">She what? Oh, my...
What a pity.
No, I...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2124">Have you heard about Lillia's husband?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
He went to find a desert flower--one that only blooms
once every ten years--in order to cure what ails Lillia.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Honestly, I'm a little jealous Lillia has such a devoted
husband, but she's been very lonely without him.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Perhaps I shouldn't have told her husband about
that flower...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2125">We spend time together as a family by hiking up the
mountain on Mondays.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2126">But all we talk about is research this, botany that....&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I wish Marie at least would talk about her love life,
or...something! Anything that isn't scientific in nature!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2127">Mother's Hill is full of things to find. I honestly do have
a good time up here.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2128">Maybe I'll make jam again.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2129">Marie's a little bookworm, so she gets along swimmingly
with her father.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I wish she'd talk to me a little more, though.
Mama needs some love too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2130">What sorts of crops do you harvest from your field,
&lt;playername&gt;? I'd love to try home-grown produce
sometime.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2131">You know, I may complain about having nothing to do,
but living a laid-back country life was always my dream.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2132">Basil's books are on the technical side, so they aren't
exactly at the top of everyone's shopping list.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
For the sake of our family's livelihood, I wish he'd write
something a little more palatable, but I can't convince
him to.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2133">The Harvest Festival gets closer by the day! Hm?
Am I looking forward to it? Of course!
Why wouldn't I be?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2134">I can't wait to see the cornucopia of ingredients
everyone's going to bring to the Harvest Festival...
Hopefully we can make something tasty.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2135">It's almost time again for the Fluffy Festival, is it?
Are you thinking about entering, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2136">I just adore Angora rabbits... I'm secretly hoping I'll get to
see one at this year's Fluffy Festival...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2137">A new beginning may be on its way, but I'm only feeling
older... Such is life, I suppose!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2138">I am Huang, merchant by trade and purveyor of fine
goods--THESE fine goods right here, in fact!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Quite a selection, yes?
Come look and buy what tickles you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2139">&lt;nickname&gt;! You are giving this to me?!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Aah! You remembered my birthday!
I overflow with happiness. Xie xie!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2140">Dear customer!
You delight me, truly!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Today is my birthday, yes? 
I humbly accept this most wonderful gift. Xie xie!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2141">&lt;nickname&gt;! You are wonderful!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
To give me something so pleasing as a present... Xie xie!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2142">Aiyaaah! You are a good person, yes?
You have made me happy. Xie xie!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2143">Aah, &lt;nickname&gt;! I love this! Xie xie!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2144">Aah, many thanks.
I like this very much.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2145">Aah! &lt;nickname&gt;, many thanks.
I humbly accept your gift.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2146">Many thanks. Xie xie.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2147">Hm? What IS this, &lt;nickname&gt;?
I will accept it, but I do not like it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2148">Aiyaaah! This is no good, dear customer. No good at all.
What use have I for something like this?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2149">&lt;nickname&gt;, pranks are not good!
Not good at all.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Was your wish to agitate me? Hm?
What am I to do with this thing now?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2150">Dear customer, pranks are not good!
You may cause me to be angry.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2151">&lt;nickname&gt;, I see you adore animals.
Animals are splendid, wonderful things.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2152">Do you like animals, dear customer?
I have good animals, yes? Secret animals, only for you.
Rare bugs, too!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Oh. Are you sure?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2153">&lt;nickname&gt;, that is hardly worth any money.
Take it away now, please.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2154">Dear customer, that is hardly worth any money.
Take it away now, please.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2155">Aiyaaah! &lt;nickname&gt;, you are really giving this
to me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2156">At the very least, it must be worth...
Factor in inflation, carry the two--we mustn't forget--
and...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2157">Ah! No, no. I must keep it. It is mine, yes?
I will take good care of it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2158">Aiyaaah! Dear customer, you are giving this to me
for free?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I could sell this for quite the pretty pen-- Ahem. No, no.
I will keep it, yes? And take good care of it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2159">Aiyaaah! &lt;nickname&gt;, you are really giving this
to me?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
This would be very popular with certain ladies, yes?
I think I could set a price of at lea-- Ahem!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
No, no. I will keep it and take good care of it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2160">Aiyaaah! Dear customer, you are giving this to me
for free?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Certain ladies would pay a high price for thi-- Ahem.
No, no. I will keep it, yes? And take good care of it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2161">&lt;nickname&gt;! That! That is for me? Ooh, my
profits! They soar in my daydreams already!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2162">Hm? For me? You are a most unselfish person,
&lt;nickname&gt;. Xie xie.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2163">Dear customer, I will gladly pay you a high price
for-- What? You will give it to me for free?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You are a most generous and unselfish person, my friend!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2164">&lt;nickname&gt;, xie xie. I have been looking forward
to today for some time.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2165">Oh! You give this to me even though I gave you nothing for
White Day?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Xie xie. You delight me, truly.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2166">Oh, a return gift for White Day, yes? Many thanks.
Xie xie.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2167">For me? Erm, ah... P-Perhaps we should not discuss this
here, yes? Let us move to your house.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2168">Good luck, dear customer. But should your fortune
be ill, I will buy that from you for a high price.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2169">Tomorrow is Starlight Night, yes?
We will have a party.
Come home between 12:00 PM and 6:00 PM.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2170">&lt;nickname&gt;, no hustling about, yes? It is not good
for the baby in your tummy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2171">Still, I had no clue that fatherhood would soon be upon me.
How prosperous in wealth will our child be, I wonder?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2172">&lt;nickname&gt;, how do you feel?
You are not ill at all?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2173">Tell me anything you need, yes?
A married couple helps one another.
That is the proper way of things.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2174">Tell me anything you need, yes?
A married couple helps one another.
That is the proper way of things.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2175">Today is White Day, yes?
But you still offer ME cookies?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Oh, you make me so very happy.
I am glad we are married. Xie xie.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2176">Today is White Day, yes?
But you still offer ME cookies?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Oh, you make me so very happy.
I am glad we are married. Xie xie.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2177">Does happiness smile upon the baby in your tummy?
I think you should be the one to name it,
&lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2178">I think our baby may be born soon, yes?
I can't wait for us to meet.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2179">&lt;nickname&gt;, Doctor and Nurse Elly will come
today. It seems the time has finally come.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2180">I hope our baby is big and healthy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2181">&lt;childname&gt; sleeps the day away.
But a sleepy child is a growing child, or so they say.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2182">&lt;childname&gt; is very cute.
As cute as you, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2183">Has &lt;childname&gt; grown? I am sure it wasn't as
hard to lift the little one before...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2184">I hope our baby becomes a merchant, like me. Then I can
sleep well knowing they will always make a good living.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2185">I wonder when &lt;childname&gt; will learn to stand?
I think it may be soon.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2186">I saw &lt;childname&gt; try to stand, even though we
have not taught the little one how. Amazing, yes?
Most amazing.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2187">Children grow up very quickly.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2188">I learn much from &lt;childname&gt; every day.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2189">I never imagined that one day I would be a Papa. But now
that I am one, I find I have taken to it gladly.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2190">I can't wait until &lt;childname&gt; learns speech.
My first lecture will be "a silver tongue begets
a gold wallet."&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2191">...Mm.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2192">I do not wish to speak to you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2193">Good morning.
You have not spoken to me much of late.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2194">&lt;nickname&gt;, is something wrong?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2195">Welcome home.
Are you going back to work?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2196">It is good to be passionate about work, but making time
for one's spouse... That is MORE good, yes?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2197">It is good to be passionate about work, but making time
for one's spouse... That is MORE good, yes?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2198">Good morning. Today is another day of working hard and
making money.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2199">&lt;nickname&gt;, you'll work hard today too, yes?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2200">Welcome home.
Did you have a profitable day today?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2201">Hm? Did *I*? Well, that is a secret. Even to my spouse,
I will not say.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2202">Good morning. Let us both work hard and bring home
good money today.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2203">Both spouses working means double the income, yes?
Please know that I will work hard so we can both live
well.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2204">Welcome home, &lt;nickname&gt;.
Did you rake in the profits today?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2205">There is so very much work to do on a farm.
It is a difficult life, yes?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But you do it well, &lt;nickname&gt;.
I have so much respect for you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2206">Good morning, &lt;nickname&gt;.
Did you sleep well?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2207">This house is very relaxing.
You have good feng shui, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2208">&lt;nickname&gt;, welcome home.
Is all going well on the farm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2209">Being a farmer must be your calling, yes?
You don't need the gift of gab to make money.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2210">Aah. &lt;nickname&gt;. Come to shop?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2211">Buy what you will buy and then leave.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2212">Aah. &lt;nickname&gt;. Come to shop?
If you need it, I have it, guaranteed!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2213">But business and private life, they are separate things,
yes? I will give no discount even if you are my wife.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2214">But business and private life, they are separate things,
yes? I will give no discount even if you are my husband.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2215">Looking for something, &lt;nickname&gt;?
Just ask and I will deliver.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2216">I sell my wares at full price, even to you,
&lt;nickname&gt;. Business and pleasure are separate.
That is my policy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2217">Aah! &lt;nickname&gt;, you are always welcome here.
Buy whatever you need.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2218">Business is business, &lt;nickname&gt;. My honored
customer is my honored customer, even if they are my
wife.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2219">Business is business, &lt;nickname&gt;. My honored
customer is my honored customer, even if they are my
husband.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2220">&lt;nickname&gt;, you came to see me? Aah, I knew my
wife would do no less. Most considerate of you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2221">&lt;nickname&gt;, you came to see me? Aah, I knew my
husband would do no less. Most considerate of you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2222">I am happy to see you. I will be even more happy if you
buy something.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2223">Aah, &lt;nickname&gt;! I am glad to see you. Please, take
your time.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2224">Of course, time is money. I will not be happy if you skipped
work to see me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2225">Aah, &lt;nickname&gt;! You came. Welcome, welcome.
Please, take your time.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2226">No honored customers have come today.
But YOU came, &lt;nickname&gt;.
That delights me, truly.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2227">Is something the matter?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2228">Whatever you may need, I stock it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2229">What is the matter, &lt;playername&gt;?
Do not stand there like a withered money tree.
Buy something, yes?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2230">I dislike cheapskates and misers.
I prefer when honored customers gladly pay, no matter
how high the price.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2231">&lt;playername&gt;! Welcome, welcome.
I am glad you came.
Please, take your time.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2232">Hmph. No customers have come today, yes?
Only you, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2233">Aiyaaah! You came all the way here?
Are you okay? Watch your step.
It is dangerous out there, yes?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2234">I am happy you came to get me, yes?
But it is dangerous here.
I worry you will trip and fall.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2235">Is &lt;childname&gt; still at home?
And behaving?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2236">I will come home at 6:00 PM, yes? I can't wait to see
&lt;childname&gt;'s little face.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2237">May I help you?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2238">I am going home now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2239">I am tired, yes? I would like to go home.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2240">I am tired, yes? Too tired to talk.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2241">&lt;nickname&gt;, I am going home now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2242">&lt;nickname&gt;, how much money did you make today?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2243">&lt;nickname&gt;, how is the farm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2244">It is very nice to have land--I mean, a house, yes?
Most relaxing.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2245">&lt;nickname&gt;, you work very hard, yes?
I favor people who work hard.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2246">You are my ideal wife, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2247">You are my ideal husband, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2248">Aiyah! &lt;nickname&gt;, what is wrong?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2249">It is not good to move around much while you have a baby
in your tummy, yes?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2250">Aiyaaah! What is &lt;childname&gt; doing?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2251">I look away and the little one disappears.
So precocious, yes? Should I be worried?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2252">I have no business with you.
I must go home now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2253">&lt;nickname&gt;, is something wrong?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2254">Lately, I find we interact less.
Did I do something wrong?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2255">Oh, &lt;nickname&gt;, it is you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2256">It is not wise to go out carrying too much money.
If it is in your pocket, you will want to spend it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2257">&lt;nickname&gt;, have you found any good ways to
make money?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2258">You are just as important as money to me,
&lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2259">Oh, &lt;nickname&gt;, it is you.
Is something wrong?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2260">Together, we will make much money, yes? Marriage is our
path to luxury--to retirement spent in ease and bliss.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2261">Together, we will make much money, yes? Marriage is our
path to luxury--to retirement spent in ease and bliss.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2262">Aah, &lt;playername&gt;! I'd completely forgotten,
what with all of my mayoral duties...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Thank you for the reminder that today is my
birthday--by way of such a lovely present, to boot.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2263">Ohohoho! What a splendid present!
You've discovered my weak spot, you rascal.
Thank you kindly.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2264">Oh ho! What have we here?
Aah, splendid, splendid!
I do so enjoy these. Thank you kindly.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2265">How very kind of you.
I am always appreciative of presents.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2266">Oh ho? What have we--
Erm.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2267">Oh ho! ...A-Ah, now what am I to do with this? I see that
you have decided to, erm...test me, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2268">Oh ho! It's no surprise that a farmer of your caliber is
accustomed to handling all sorts of animals and insects.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2269">AAAIIIEEE!
Heeeeelp!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2270">Well, well! A mighty fine item indeed!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Thank you kindly. You know, if Harris ever decides to
marry, I think I may give this as a gift to his spouse.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2271">Well, isn't THIS quite the fashionable item! Hm?
You intended it to be a gift for me?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
A lovely thought, no doubt, but I'm afraid I have no use
for it. Perhaps I will gift it to Harris' future spouse.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2272">Well, isn't THIS quite the fashionable item! Does the
scent not disturb your animals when you wear it, though?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Hm? You intended it as a gift for me? How thoughtful!
Thank you kindly.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2273">Aah, most kind of you! Valentine's Day loses its sheen if
you don't receive chocolates at least once, you know.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2274">Aah, most kind of you! Valentine's Day loses its sheen if
you don't receive chocolates at least once, you know.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2275">Ohohoho! Wonderful news, my friend! Wonderful
news indeed! I am certain you have a bright future
ahead of you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2276">&lt;playername&gt;, have you heard of Forgotten Valley?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
This is only a rumor, mind you, but I hear that a resident
farmer there is a local celebrity.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I would like to meet this person someday...and perhaps
shake their hand, should they be sufficiently
magnanimous.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2277">Some years ago, I shared my roof with a gentleman by
the name of Kanno.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
He was a photographer, you see. Had a real fondness for
taking pictures of Mineral Town's scenery.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But one day, I returned home to find he had left, leaving
behind only a letter. I wonder where he is now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2278">By Jove, you've done it! You have won our venerable
Cooking Exhibition ten times! As mayor, I couldn't be
prouder!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2279">Now, this is only a rumor I heard from the mayor of
a neighboring town the other day...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2280">But apparently, word of your excellence in our illustrious
Cooking Exhibition has reached even Forgotten Valley.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2281">&lt;playername&gt;, I hear you bested even a professional
chef as part of your culinary conquest. Most impressive!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2282">Hmph. Play innocent all you like--you will not fool me.
I can see straight through you, you know.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
What were you thinking, trying to sneak behind my back
like that? Have you no respect for my mayoral station?!&lt;wait&gt;
</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2283">...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2284">So, you insist upon feigning ignorance?
You are aware that the ENTIRE WORLD
is talking about you, are you not?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2285">What? You have done nothing? No, no. Surely you jest.
You MUST have done something. What was it?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2286">Wait...!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2287">No... NO!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2288">Egads! It couldn't be!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2289">Are you plotting to usurp my position as mayor of
Mineral Town?! No! I will not have it, you hear?
I will NOT have it!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
My family has served this town for generations!
I REFUSE you the latitude to besmirch our good name!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2290">Hm? You were plotting no such thing?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2291">Oh! O-Of course not! Ohohoho! You would never do such a
thing. No, not you! I never believed it for a second.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Splendid! Splendid indeed!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2292">Now, then...what were we talking about?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2293">&lt;playername&gt;, you are a nonpareil of Mineral Town
excellence! Truly a model citizen!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2294">Hrm? What do I mean? Oh, come now!
There is no need to feign humility.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
After all, you put the kibosh on a WAR! Tired of all the
fighting, you appealed to the two countries'
representatives...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...and then melted their hearts with handmade dishes
originating from their hometowns. Or so I hear.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2295">The representatives were so moved by your cooking that
they called a cease-fire on the spot. Or so I was told.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2296">Aaah, what a splendid story! I've always had a weakness
for such tales of courage and selflessness.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
They tug on my heartstrings like you would not believe.
When I caught wind of your glorious deeds...
Oh, how I wept!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2297">&lt;playername&gt;, you are a hero who has saved the
peoples of not one, but TWO entire countries.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2298">Three cheers for &lt;playername&gt;!
Huzzah! Huzzah! HUZZAAAH!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2299">Word is that you are preparing to leave on a journey to
collect legendary cooking ingredients.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2300">I've always hoped I might one day have the opportunity to
catch a glimpse of such culinary commodities.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2301">Should you find one, I would be most honored if you'd
bring it to me. Don't worry. I will only touch with my eyes.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2302">Aah...! I can only imagine how superlative those
ingredients must be to have earned their "legendary"
moniker!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2303">Hm? Is something the matter?
You are giving me a most quizzical look.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2304">Wh-What? You are planning no such thing? Oh, come, now!
There is no need to hide it from me!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2305">...Ohhh!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2306">Ahem. I understand. Your secret is safe with me. I will let
not one word of it pass my lips! You can trust me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2307">I hear you went on a grand adventure to acquire
legendary ingredients!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2308">You wandered through a deep jungle, forging
ahead--step by rough step--only to be attacked
by an indigenous tribe!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2309">Kidnapped, you were tied to a pole and carted to their
village, where they forced you to cook for them, I heard.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2310">But with one bite of your cooking, the tribe's rage
dissipated! They even conferred upon you a title, I believe.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2311">Oh, what was it again? Erm... Oh, yes! They dubbed you
their "Grand Poobah"! Or so I was told.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2312">I can't say I fully understand what that means,
but the whole endeavor sounds quite exhilarating.
Well met, Poobah!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2313">I further heard that upon induction to their tribe,
they told you of the cave where the legendary
ingredients slept.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
With a young lad of the tribe as your guide,
you courageously set forth to retrieve them!
...Or so the rumor says.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2314">Yet unbeknownst to you, that perilous cave would be
fraught with all manner of insidious dangers!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2315">A deluge of snakes, raining from above!
An infestation of scorpions, scuttling forth from
the inky depths!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2316">Nevertheless, you braved that danger and reached
the cave's depths, wherein the legendary ingredients
awaited you!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Well, so I heard. Still, you had yourself quite an adventure,
especially for a farmer of your tender age.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2317">Hm? Goodness, why are you giving me such a puzzled look?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2318">Oh! Oh, yes! Fear not--your secret is safe with me.
I have not breathed a word of this to another soul.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
No one will learn from me that you now possess the
legendary ingredients, oh, no. You have my word.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2319">After all, I'm sure you want to keep it under wraps that
you had to fight you-know-who in a grand battle to the
death.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2320">"You-know-who WHO," you say? Oh, come, now!
You are being coy yet again. You know exactly who
I speak of.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2321">You were attempting to learn the Final Ultimate
Technique of Culinary Majesty, the--er, what was
it named again?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2322">Anyway! *mumble* was a master of this technique, which
is why you sought *cough*'s tutelage, of course.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2323">But in order to learn this technique, your final trial was
to defeat your teacher in one-on-one combat! Right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2324">I can't seem to recall the particulars of that technique
at the moment, but was it worth all the grueling effort?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2325">Erm, I'm afraid your silence does not tell me one way
or the other...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2326">Oh! Ohhh! No, no. Say no more.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You do not wish to speak lightly of your master and the
ordeal you underwent together. I understand. Completely.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2327">That...is what you meant. I'm sure.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2328">Message received. I shall speak of your revered master
no more.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2329">No one shall learn of *mumble* from me--you can be
certain of that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2330">&lt;playername&gt;, is it true that you vanquished the
Android Annihilator?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2331">Why, the Android Annihilator is supposedly one of the
mightiest generals in the Evil Overlord's army!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2332">To defeat such a terrifying foe with aplomb...
I always knew that you were a man destined for glory!
Yes, that I did!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2333">...I mean, er, a great woman!
Yes, that's right. Slip of the tongue.
But more importantly!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2334">With the Android Annihilator's defeat, the Evil Overlord
will surely bring his full might to bear against you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2335">Please be ever so cautious when you are walking the
roads at night.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2336">Though considering you defeated the Android Annihilator,
I doubt any danger will be too great for you to handle.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2337">Some say that hidden deep within Forgotten Valley,
there lies the secret lair of the Evil Overlord.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2338">Hoe in hand, a farmer clutches seed to breast, heroically
charging into that den and vanquishing its dark minions...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2339">Your legend writes itself! Then you faced off against the
Overlord in one-on-one combat and defeated him with
ease...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2340">No surprise at all, considering you learned the Final
Ultimate Technique from your master, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2341">Simply standing before you is an honor. From now on,
I dub thee Master &lt;playername&gt;, Savior of the
World.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2342">Master &lt;playername&gt;, Savior of the World, please
accept this token of our most humble and sincere
gratitude.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2343">Master &lt;playername&gt;, Savior of the World, was that
token insufficient? Then please, take this as well.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2344">Ah, Master &lt;playername&gt;, Savior of the World,
a thousand humble pardons. I have displeased you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2345">If my paltry offerings are not enough to demonstrate my
gratitude, what might I present to you to--&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2346">Hm? You prefer NOT to be called Master
&lt;playername&gt;, Savior of the World?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2347">You would rather I call you by your name, as I have
always done before?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2348">If that is your wish, Master &lt;playername&gt;, Savior of
the World, I am bound and compelled to oblige...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2349">Erm! I mean... Thy will be done, &lt;playername&gt;. Ack!
Take three! Ahem! Certainly, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2350">And so yet another peaceful day passes in our peaceful
town. As mayor, I could not be happier.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2351">Another day spent hard at work, &lt;playername&gt;?
It must be quite tiring. You could at least take the
weekend off.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2352">But I'm sure that is easier said than done for someone
with a farm to maintain, hm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2353">Hrm. It does not seem like this will let up anytime soon.
And here I was hoping to take a stroll to the Plaza...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2354">For me, there are few greater pleasures than spending
a weekend afternoon with Ellen over a piece of apple pie.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Both she and I are diehard devotees of the apple pie they
serve at the Inn. It is marvelously delicious.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2355">Good day, &lt;playername&gt;. I was just on my way to do
some shopping.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2356">My, my! If it isn't &lt;playername&gt;.
Good day! How fares the farm?
Is all going well?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2357">No one is particularly good at a task when they try it
for the first time.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Doubly so when it is a task as complex as managing
a farm. It will take time to learn the ins and outs.
Have patience.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2358">Good day to you, &lt;playername&gt;!
How fares the farm?
Have you acclimated to your new life?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2359">I'm afraid I can't say much in regards to farms
and farming...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But I do mean to provide you all the assistance that I can
via other avenues.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2360">A good day to you, &lt;playername&gt;!
I hear you are working hard on the farm.
How does it fare?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2361">Oh ho! Is that so? I'm afraid I know little of the
nitty-gritty, but I DO know that our lives depend
on farmers.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Thank you very much for all that you do,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2362">Good day, &lt;playername&gt;.
Are you taking a short rest too?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2363">No doubt the animals must feel invigorated on a beautiful
day like today.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2364">Good day, &lt;playername&gt;. How are you?
Does our humble Mineral Town feel more like home yet?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2365">If you are in need of anything, do not hesitate to ask.
I will gladly help you in every way that I can.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2366">Saps and seedlings, what a day!
Does it ever intend to let up?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2367">I was hoping to go to the Plaza if the weather would
cooperate. I cannot recall if I updated the notice board
or not.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2368">Drat! Snowfall once again. I was hoping for a more
relaxing day off today.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2369">Harris generally comes to the Inn at this hour.
On climatically uncooperative days, I do the same.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It always makes me feel better when Harris tells me
that nothing problematic has happened in town.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2370">This Plaza is a place of peace, rest, and togetherness for
everyone in town.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I am never so glad to be mayor as when I come here on
festival days and reap the bounty of everyone's smiling
faces.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2371">Are you enjoying the festival?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm delighted to see that you seem to be getting on well
with everyone in town.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2372">Good day, &lt;playername&gt;. Have you noticed how
diverse our community is here in Mineral Town?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
When you befriend people of varied backgrounds, it
expands your worldview, making your life richer for it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2373">How have you been, &lt;playername&gt;?
Is all going well?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Not that I need to ask. You have already cemented
yourself as a valued and respected member of our
community.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2374">Tomorrow's our Mochi Bonanza. Keep working hard out
there, and build up that appetite for some tasty mochi!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2375">Entering our Spring Derby this year, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I hope you've made all the necessary preparations!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2376">I hope you'll buy tickets at tomorrow's Derby! N-No,
I'm not just saying that because a percentage of ticket
proceeds will go towards our fair town!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2377">If you're going to be whipping us up a dish for the Cooking
Exhibition, you'll have to prepare something extra special
to impress Bon Vivant.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2378">Whenever the Cooking Exhibition comes 'round, simply
thinking of all the splendid culinary delights we'll be
seeing makes my mouth water!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2379">Preparations for the Fetch Fest are so tiresome...
The heat tends to be unbearable this time of year,
but I must press on! For the adorable pets!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2380">Is your pet competing in the Fetch Fest, as well?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm very much looking forward to seeing all our cute,
cuddly competitors tomorrow!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2381">The Cluck-Cluck Clash looms upon us, &lt;playername&gt;!
Why not enter one of your feathered friends?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2382">I wonder what kinds of chickens we'll see tomorrow?
Either way, I'm sure it'll be a clucking good time! Oho!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2383">Why not enter a cow in the Moo-Moo Festival? I'm sure
the judge would be moooved by a cow from your farm!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2384">Here's a Moo-Moo Festival fun fact: prize-winning cows
always have a unique sort of dignity to them! I hope you'll
attend tomorrow!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2385">The Harvest Festival is in just TWO days! I'm counting on
you of all people to bring us a stellar ingredient!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2386">I eagerly await this year's Harvest Festival! It warms
my heart to see our little ingredient collection
every year.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2387">Entering our Autumn Derby this year,
&lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I hope you've made all the necessary preparations!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2388">I hope you'll buy tickets at tomorrow's Derby! N-No,
I'm not just saying that because a percentage of ticket
proceeds will go towards our fair town!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2389">Fluffy Festival fun fact for you: alpacas and Angora
rabbits are also eligible to compete!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2390">Ahh, yes, the Fluffy Festival... Sheep, alpacas, Angora
rabbits...they're all welcome! I'm eager to see them all!&lt;wait&gt; </Entry>
  <Entry Index="2391">Tomorrow's our Pumpkin Jamboree! It's guaranteed to
be a pumpkin-tastic time for us all!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2392">The New Year's Party is closing in on us! I hope you'll
come ring in the new year with us.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2393">Hello there. Oh, I haven't seen you around here before.
Did you move onto that farm?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Wow. That's impressive. Ah, I haven't introduced myself
yet, have I?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
My name is Elly.
It's nice to meet you, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2394">Hello there. Oh, I haven't seen you around here before.
Did you move onto that farm?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Wow. That's impressive. Ah, I haven't introduced myself
yet, have I?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
My name is Elly.
It's nice to meet you, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2395">Wow, a birthday present?
I'm so happy. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2396">Thank you.
I'm always happy to get presents on my birthday,
no matter how old I get.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2397">A birthday present?
Wow, is it really all right for me to have something
so luxurious?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Wasn't this expensive?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2398">Hm? A birthday present?
Wow, I...I don't know what to say.
Are you sure? Thank you so much.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2399">Hm? This is for me?
Thank you for such a wonderful birthday present. Really.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2400">Thank you, &lt;nickname&gt;.
I feel so fortunate to have a wife like you. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2401">Thank you, &lt;nickname&gt;.
I feel so fortunate to have a husband like you. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2402">Whoa! This is for me? Thank you.
I'm going to be smiling for the rest of the day.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2403">Thank you, &lt;nickname&gt;.
I honestly love it. You know me well.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2404">Thank you. I'm so happy.
But is it really all right for me
to receive something so...so...?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2405">Thank you! You're so kind to me, and yet I feel like I'm
always putting you through the wringer.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2406">Thank you. This is nice.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2407">Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2408">Huh? This is, um...
Did you keep the receipt, by chance?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2409">I-I mustn't turn down an act of generosity... I'm always
telling Yu not to be picky, after all.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2410">That is QUITE enough of that!
Why would you bring something like this to me
on purpose?!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2411">Why would you do this to me?
You're a horrible person!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2412">Hmmm? Yeees?
Hee hee. Simply adorable.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2413">Positively precious.
Don't you think so, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2414">Positively precious.
Don't you think so, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2415">Eeek! Oh, grow up and stop playing tricks on people!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2416">Eeek! What are you doing?!
Yu is rubbing off on you, and I don't like it one bit!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2417">Thank you.
So, what about it?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2418">Huh? Are you sure? It looks so far out of my income
bracket...but thank you. I'll treasure it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2419">Wow, you're giving this to me?
Thank you. I'll treasure it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2420">Thank you so much.
Not even in my dreams did I imagine I'd receive such
a thoughtful gift.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2421">Thank you.
This must've been pretty expensive, no?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2422">Wow, simply wonderful.
And you're giving it to me as a gift?
Thank you very much.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2423">Perfume is wonderful. It can make you feel like a
completely different person. I'll try putting it on later.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2424">Thank you.
I'll definitely use this.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2425">I've...never once worn this in my life. Thank you for helping
one of my dreams come true. I'm so happy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2426">It feels a little strange to receive cookies on this day,
but I'll take them. Thank you for being thoughtful.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2427">Hm? Today is Valentine's Day.
You're sure you meant to give this to me? Well, thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2428">Thank you.
White Day cookies, I presume?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2429">May I really have this?
Thank you. I apologize for not giving you anything
last year.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2430">Thank you.
You remembered to return the favor.
You're very conscientious.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2431">B-But I'm not emotionally prepared for this...
Before I get ahead of myself, let's go to your
house, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2432">B-But I'm not emotionally prepared for this...
Before I get ahead of myself, let's go to your
house, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2433">Oh my, are you going to propose?
Hee hee, best wishes for you and the lucky bride
or groom.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2434">I want to continue helping Doctor for now. Forgive me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2435">Oh, why are you suddenly taking that Preserved Flower
out? It would be a shame if you lost it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2436">Will you come to my house tomorrow for
Starlight Night? Grandma and Yu would love
to see you too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2437">I'll be cooking up a real feast, so I hope you come hungry.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2438">Oh, right. I understand.
I'm sure you have more than enough going on,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2439">Oh, right. I understand.
I'm sure you have more than enough going on,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2440">I'll be slaving away over a hot stove all day tomorrow to
prep for Starlight Night, so let's spend it together.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2441">I'm so happy. I've dreamed of motherhood for so long. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2442">You should think of a name, &lt;nickname&gt;. ∀
Or am I being a little too hasty?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2443">Good morning. The baby and I are both feeling wonderful.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2444">Women are so blessed. The joy of motherhood is truly
special--not that fatherhood is any less special.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2445">Good morning.
I can feel the baby moving around now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2446">Given how rowdy the little one is being even before birth,
maybe that means we can expect a boy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2447">I'm scheduled to give birth tomorrow.
Will you stay with me and hold my hand?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2448">I expect no complications, particularly because Doctor
will be there to see me through labor.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2449">Yu is running around telling everyone that he's a big
brother now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2450">Grandma is thrilled about &lt;childname&gt;'s
arrival too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2451">Babies are just so cheek-pinchingly cute.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2452">Yu comes to visit on occasion. He's so tentative, though.
All he does is peek in and then leave in a hurry.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2453">&lt;childname&gt;'s grabbing onto things and standing
a little bit now. Will they start walking soon, I wonder?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2454">Such a hefty baby. They've grown so much that I can't
carry them as easily as I used to.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2455">&lt;childname&gt; reminds me of Yu when he was young.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Always winding up face-down in the dirt, tears streaming
down his face...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I would lose my patience and tell him to stop crying over
every little thing, but maybe I was too hard on him.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2456">Once &lt;childname&gt; gets bigger,
I hope they make lots of friends.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2457">&lt;childname&gt; wants to talk with you,
&lt;nickname&gt;. ♪&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2458">A sobering thought: once our baby starts talking more,
I don't know WHAT I'll do if they end up being cheeky
like Yu.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If that happens, I think it would stand as proof that
I don't know how to raise a child properly. *sigh*&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2459">I'm sorry. I'm tired and don't want to talk right now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2460">...Hmph.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2461">Good morning.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2462">Don't you have work to do?
We have things to discuss afterwards.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2463">Hmmm...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2464">Do you want to eat at the Inn today?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2465">Do your best out there today.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2466">Well, I suppose I should get cooking.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2467">Hurry and finish working so we can spend the evening
together, okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2468">Good morning. How are you feeling?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2469">Don't overwork yourself. If you end up in the Clinic and
waste a whole day, you'll regret not taking it easier.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2470">Did you wash your hands?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2471">I'm so sorry.
It's just one failure after another.
Don't subject yourself to my cooking.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2472">Morning, &lt;nickname&gt;. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2473">Good luck at work today. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2474">Are you taking a break?
You mustn't overwork yourself.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2475">What in the world is the matter?
You're acting strange, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2476">You don't need to fret so. The baby is fine.
And Doctor is always there for us.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2477">Settle down, &lt;nickname&gt;, and go do your work. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2478">Oh, &lt;nickname&gt;.
Is &lt;childname&gt; doing all right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2479">We have to work hard for &lt;childname&gt;'s sake
as well.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2480">You're getting in my way, so if you're not sick,
please leave.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2481">You DO know you're in a Clinic, right? This is a place of
rest and healing. Please quiet down.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2482">*sigh*
What is it?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2483">I'll return home on schedule, so please head back
without me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2484">Oh? What about your farm work?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2485">If you feel ill at all, please see Doctor without delay.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2486">What's the matter, &lt;nickname&gt;?
Huh? You say have a stomachache because of my cooking?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2487">Ugh, you're such a prankster.
Do you know what I do to pranksters?
...I use the extra-large needle.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2488">Are you unwell, &lt;nickname&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2489">There's nothing to worry about, you say?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Well, that's a relief.
I was worried that you might be sick.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2490">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;.
Is something amiss?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2491">If you feel unwell, you should have Doctor examine you.
Don't be shy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2492">Oh, so you came to buy medicine today?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2493">If I'm going to get married,
it has to be to someone I respect.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2494">Everyone says I lose my cool when I'm around Doctor.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I don't have a very wifely demeanor--whatever that
means--if the local gossip is to be believed.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2495">My motherly instincts are kicking in.
I think raising Yu has gotten me used to the idea of
having children.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2496">Doctor keeps asking how long I plan to keep working at
the clinic.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
As long as I can, honestly. So long as a certain physician
doesn't nag me to death first...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2497">Hm? What's the matter today?
Do you need to speak with Doctor?
Oh, does something not feel right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2498">I've noticed recently that Doctor resembles my dad a
little. Strange, huh?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2499">Are you all right?
Did you catch a cold?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2500">Nothing has changed at work.
He sees the patients, and I assist.
It's that simple.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2501">Oh, hello, &lt;playername&gt;.
Did you come to see Doctor?
You're such a cute couple.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2502">Oh, hello, &lt;playername&gt;.
Did you come to see Doctor?
You're such a cute couple.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2503">It must be so nice.
Me? I don't have time for romance. Work and other
obligations keep me busy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2504">Curiosity compels me to ask... Does Doctor still act the
same even when he's at home, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2505">Curiosity compels me to ask... Does Doctor still act the
same even when he's at home, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2506">You know his lab coat?
I've always been curious if he wears that at home, too.
No, really!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I've never seen him in casual clothes, so I admit my
imagination had started to run away with me...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2507">Oh, what brings you here, &lt;playername&gt;? Did you pull
a muscle doing all that heavy labor? I imagine it's intense.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2508">Oh, what brings you here, &lt;playername&gt;? Did you pull
a muscle doing all that heavy labor? I imagine it's intense.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2509">Luckily for you, you have Doctor at home, so you'll be fine
if anything ever goes awry.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2510">Hello, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2511">Hello, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2512">How are you feeling?
If there's ever something wrong, no matter how small,
come see Doctor.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2513">You seem so happy, &lt;playername&gt;.
Look, you've even got me smiling.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2514">You seem so happy, &lt;playername&gt;.
Look, you've even got me smiling.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2515">How is your spouse?
If they ever get sick, send them right over.
We'll take good care of them.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2516">Say hello to your spouse for me,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2517">Hello, &lt;playername&gt;.
How are things on the farm?
Are you working hard?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2518">Are you treating your spouse with the love and respect
they deserve, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2519">When you live with someone, you can rest easy knowing
that they're only a shout away if something should
happen.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2520">You mustn't fight with your spouse.
Hm? Well, I suppose there ARE quarrels born out of
intimacy and affection...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2521">Grandma was so pleased to hear about our marriage.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2522">Yu was happy, too. He kept saying how excited he was to
get a "real older brother." Little does he know...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2523">What's the matter today?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2524">If you want to buy medicine, please talk to me.
If you want an examination, please go to Doctor.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2525">Oh, hello, &lt;playername&gt;.
Are you feeling well today?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2526">Oh, hello, &lt;playername&gt;.
Are you feeling well today?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2527">Farm work must be so taxing.
I imagine it requires a lot of stamina.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2528">My family--Grandma included--has helped women give
birth for generations. I'm proud of our legacy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2529">It seems there's a cold going around, so please be sure to
take the necessary precautions.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2530">You know my grandma, right? I'm studying here because
I want to discover a cure for her leg deterioration.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2531">Oh, hello, &lt;playername&gt;.
Something tells me you've gotten used to life on the farm.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2532">Oh, hello, &lt;playername&gt;.
Something tells me you've gotten used to life on the farm.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

asked you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

&lt;playername&gt;? It occurs to me that I never even

What is it?
Does something hurt somewhere?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2536">Oh, it's you, &lt;playername&gt;!
What is it?
Does something hurt somewhere?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

not having anyone around if you were to get hurt or sick.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="2539">I wonder if I'd have to quit working at the Clinic if I got
married.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2540">I'm not confident that I could handle both work AND all
the obligations that come with being married.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2541">Good morning, &lt;playername&gt;.
The Clinic is closed today, so I'm spending the day at
home.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2542">Doctor is wandering around somewhere.
He sometimes hikes up the mountain to look for medicinal
plants.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But on days when the sun won't come out, he gets
together with Carter instead.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I wonder what men talk about when they're alone...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2543">Good morning, &lt;playername&gt;.
If you're looking for Doctor, I think he's in his room.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2544">Oh, but...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2545">If it's not an emergency,
could you wait until the Clinic opens?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I like to let him rest in the mornings.
He's always behind on his sleep.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2546">I'm going shopping today. I need both groceries for home
and some necessities for the Clinic.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2547">I haven't had a day off in a while.
I forgot how nice it is to relax.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2548">I do admit it's a little lonely not having Doctor by my side,
though.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2549">Every tomorrow is an opportunity to be better than
today. 
See you then, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2550">This room was originally Doctor's.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
That's why it still has so many educational books to read.
I like to study them after work when I have time.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2551">The books in the other room, though... My poor brain shuts
down when I see words with more than five syllables.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2552">Oh, hello, &lt;playername&gt;!
The Clinic is closed today.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Are you feeling all right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2553">Oh, hello, &lt;playername&gt;!
The Clinic is closed today.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Are you feeling all right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2554">On my days off, I spend time with my grandma. You're
welcome to join us for tea sometime, if you'd like.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2555">Oh, good morning, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2556">Oh, good morning, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2557">You're very energetic, given the early hour.
I'm still half-asleep myself.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2558">Good evening, &lt;playername&gt;.
I'm always grateful for days when I can see both
Grandma and Yu.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2559">Good evening, &lt;playername&gt;.
I'm always grateful for days when I can see both
Grandma and Yu.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2560">Tomorrow, it's back to the daily grind at the Clinic.
Not that I don't value the learning experience.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2561">Good evening, &lt;playername&gt;.
You must be tired after all your work.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2562">Good evening, &lt;playername&gt;.
You must be tired after all your work.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2563">What brings you here at this hour?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2564">Doctor's always chiding me and telling me to relax at
home when the Clinic is closed.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2565">Where is HE, you ask? In the Library or at the Church, I
believe.
He tends to like quiet places.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2566">Hello. The Clinic is closed on Wednesdays. Incidentally,
we don't see each other much outside of there, do we?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2567">I'd really appreciate it if you'd spend some time with
Grandma. She's homebound and can get rather bored,
you see.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2568">Today is my weekly shopping day.
Also, Doctor's tab needs paying,
so I'm taking care of that for him.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2569">Sasha from the General Store is so nice. She often
comes to check on my grandma on her days off.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2570">Tomorrow's the Mochi Bonanza, but do be careful you
don't overeat or choke on your mochi.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2571">Will you be entering a cow from your farm for this
year's Moo-Moo Festival, too? I'd love to see it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2572">It's finally the Moo-Moo Festival tomorrow, isn't it?
There are quite a few different types of cows...
I wonder what kinds we'll get to see there.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2573">Our yearly Concert is coming up soon, if you haven't
heard. I've got quite a lot of rehearsals ahead of me...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2574">The Concert's tomorrow... Wh-What? N-No, of course I'm
not nervous!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2575">The Fireworks Festival is almost here. Fireworks and
summer go hand-in-hand, wouldn't you say?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2576">They say it takes a village to make a good Harvest
Festival meal. I wonder what our village will cook up
this year?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2577">I'd like to bring an ingredient I haven't before to
tomorrow's Harvest Festival...I'm just not quite
sure what.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2578">I hope the weather stays nice for tomorrow's
Moonlight Night...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You'll be going, too, won't you?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2579">The Autumn Derby is in a few days! I love watching the
horses and all the hard work they do. They're such
wonderful animals.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2580">Hmm... I suppose it wouldn't hurt to buy tickets for the
Derby.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2581">You're not from around here, huh?
Whoa, you moved onto that big ol' farm?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Me? I'm Yu. Nice to meetcha, lady.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

a super awesome toy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="2593">Heh heh heh. Can I have that?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2594">Thanks. When I grow up, I'll give it to a girl I like.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2595">Thanks. But I'm not gonna use this, so I'll give it to Elly.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2596">Gross! That stinks! What IS it?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2597">Yaaay! Thanks! I love Valentine's 'cuz it means I get to
chow down on chocolate.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2598">Wow, that's super pretty. Oh yeah, I think we've got one
like that at home, too.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Elly said it belonged to Mom, though.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2599">Apparently, there's this huuuge lizard in a place called
Forgotten Valley.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

  <Entry Index="2605">Heyyy, it's Mr. McFarmsalot!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2606">Have you ever ridden a cow?
I wanna try riding one juuust once.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I guess that sounds like a rodeo, huh? Even though those
have bulls instead of cows 'n all.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2607">Oh, hey, Ms. McFarmsalot.
Wouldja play with me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2608">Oh, hey, Mr. McFarmsalot.

  <Entry Index="2609">Elly's busy at work, and Grandma's legs are messed up,
so I'm kinda lonely.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2610">Today I'm going to Church. Are you "pie-us" or whatever
they call it?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's important to "con-fuss," right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2611">Today I'm going to Church. Are you "pie-us" or whatever

  <Entry Index="2612">Carter says that if you say you're REALLY sorry for
doin' somethin' bad, everything'll be forgiven.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I wonder if that means Elly'll forgive me for putting bugs
in her bed?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2613">Awww, it's all gloomy today.
Wonder if Mei's cooped up at home too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2614">I wish someone'd take me to Church even when the
weather is all yucky.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Maybe Carter'll come get me if I say "pretty please."&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2615">I don't go to Church on this day.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Elly doesn't work on Wednesdays, and Mei goes out with
her grandpa on Mondays.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2616">And besides, if I had to play House every day, I'd get
suuuper bored of it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="2618">Evenin', Mr. McFarmsalot.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="2621">Oh, Mr. McFarmsalot! Hey.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2622">Carter makes the BEST snacks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2623">I'm gonna eat lots and lots of mochi tomorrow!
Just you wait!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2624">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;! D'you have any cows
in the Moo-Moo Festival?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2625">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;! D'you have any cows
in the Moo-Moo Festival?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2626">The cows at the Moo-Moo Festival are suuuper huge,
and there's always so many of them! It's kinda scary,
actually...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2627">Elly's been practicing for the Concert a whooole bunch.
When I get big, I wanna try singing with everyone, too!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2628">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;? Are you gonna be a part of this
year's Concert, too?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2629">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;? Are you gonna be a part of this
year's Concert, too?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2630">Hm? Who're you?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Huh. So you're the new caretaker of that farm?
I'm Duke. Nice to meet you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2631">Oh ho! A birthday present?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Wow, I bet everyone loves you, huh?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2632">Oh ho! Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm a simple man--I'm happy as long as I have honest work
and a full belly. Thanks for helping me with the latter.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2633">Oh ho! Thank you. I think I'll hide it from Manna and keep
it all to myself.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2634">Thank you. I'll take it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2635">Hm? What's this? At least tell me it has a good
flavor profile.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2636">Is this some kind of joke?
You're making fun of me, aren't you?!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2637">Hahaha. Adorable.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2638">Ah... These fellas are always a real pain in the butt.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You're not so fond of wild dogs, right?
Well, it's just like that for me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2639">Huh? You sure about this?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Huh. Then maybe I'll give it to Adge.
Or Manna, I guess.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2640">Huh? You sure I can have this?
I'll plan on giving it to Adge, then.
It wouldn't suit Manna, trust me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2641">Hm? Perfume? Talk about literally putting on
a pretentious air.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Wait, what? It's for me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2642">Oh ho! Thank you.
I wonder if Manna will give me any.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Not that I particularly care.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2643">Hahaha, so someone's caught your eye, eh?
Well, good luck.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2644">Hey there, &lt;playername&gt;. If you want to buy
something to drink, the house is thataway.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2645">Oh, and if you DO end up going there, could you keep
Manna company for a while? Please and thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2646">I don't really go to the Inn because I particularly crave
their food--I just like talking with the regulars.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2647">Cliff is rooming at the Inn, you know. He doesn't eat much,
but he has a fairly sophisticated palate.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2648">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;. Always nice to go out with the
family on a day off.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2649">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;. You working hard?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2650">On days like today, when that afternoon sun is high in the
sky, my mind always seems to wander until I'm darn near
slack-jawed.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2651">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;.
...What? There something on my face?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I didn't drink at all today, for the record.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2652">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2653">What are you doing here this late at night? We only sell
things during the day, you know.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2654">Manna and I live by ourselves in this house, so we'd
welcome some company every now and then.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2655">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;. How's the farm?
Crops flourishing, animals happy, all that jazz?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2656">Cliff's been a great help to us. And he seems happier now
that he's married to you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Having someone you truly care about really does make all
the difference in your quality of life.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2657">Cliff's been a great help to us. And he seems happier now
that he's married to you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

  <Entry Index="2658">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;. How's Cliff?
What's he like at home? Do tell.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2659">Apparently, Manna's worked herself into a total frenzy
worrying about him.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I, for one, can't be bothered to sweat that kinda stuff.
...So, uh, how's he doing, though?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2660">Hey. If you're buying something, Manna's your go-to gal.
...You know, my wife?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2661">Manna loves the sound of her own voice, so it might be
hard to actually, y'know, BUY something from her.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But the reality is that she's just lonely, so I hope you'll
forgive her.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2662">Hey. How are things?
Have you gotten used to your work?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Well, pour yourself a drink of your preferred libation
and take it easy, eh?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2663">The human brain is simple, you know.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Simple to trick, at least. If you convince yourself that
something is good for you, you won't get sick from it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2664">We're eating out as a family today!
We stopped doing this after Adge left.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2665">We're going to Church with Cliff today.
I'd never so much as set foot in there until recently.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Turns out it's not so bad to have somewhere quiet and
empty to clear your head every once in a while.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2666">Hey. Did you come for a bite too, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2667">Manna? I have no idea what she's doing right now.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Apparently, she'd rather gossip with the neighbors than
cook for me. Figures.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2668">You look like you're really busting your butt out there.
Cliff is too, y'know.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2669">Dudley's always going on about what a great guy Cliff is.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Contrary to what you might expect, he's actually
a pretty popular guy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2670">Good to see ya, &lt;playername&gt;!
Are you done working?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2671">I work myself to the bone every day too, you know.
I've earned myself at least a small drink,
wouldn't you say?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2672">Now that Cliff's pitching in, my work is a lot easier than
it used to be.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm truly grateful to you for connecting us,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2673">Cliff's made no secret of the fact that he's thankful too.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
He was saying he probably wouldn't be here if he hadn't
found this job.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2674">Hey there, &lt;playername&gt;. What are you doing down
here in the Cellar? We sell drinks at the house, not here.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2675">Nice and cool down here, eh? And this is the only place
you can hear the wine talk. It's alive, just like you or me.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
As long as I'm working here, I don't think I'll ever want
to retire.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2676">Once &lt;childname&gt; gets bigger, you're welcome to
come by for a tour.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2677">We may not be related by blood, but I think of
&lt;childname&gt; as my own grandchild.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Manna feels the same way, of course.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2678">Oh, you're here too, &lt;playername&gt;?
This place is pretty much the definition of "serene."&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2679">I always thought Church was a strict, suffocating place,
but it turns out that's not true in the slightest.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2680">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;. Y'know, as it turns out, Carter is
a surprisingly decent guy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2681">Ever since Cliff came into our lives, I've changed my mind
about a lot of things.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Before, I'd just spend Saturdays in a semi-lucid haze.
Now, well...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2682">Wine comes down to the quality of the fruit used to
make it. Period.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The fruit I painstakingly raise always makes
top-quality wine.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2683">This Winery is named after my daughter.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
"Adge Winery," I call it. What do you think? A perfect
name, right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2684">Hope you've gotten used to how much of a chatterbox
Manna is... Well, have you?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If you can tune out the petty stuff, listening to her should
give you a solid sense of the town dynamics.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2685">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;. Fancy having a glass of my
favorite libation with me sometime?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You know, now that I get a better look at you, you remind
me of my daughter.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2686">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;. Fancy having a glass of my
favorite libation with me sometime?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

me of myself in my youth.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2687">The Mochi Bonanza's tomorrow, huh? Count me in.
I'll be eating my fill for sure.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2688">What's that? You wanna know the odds for the
Derby horses?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You and me both, friend. You and me both...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2689">I always get real worked up come Derby time.
I look forward to 'em every year.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2690">Will we be seeing any chickens of yours in this year's
Cluck-Cluck Clash, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2691">The Cluck-Cluck Clash is tomorrow... It's a real lively
little festival, so it's definitely a favorite of mine.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2692">What's that? You wanna know the odds for the
Derby horses?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You and me both, friend. You and me both...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2693">I always get real worked up come Derby time.
I look forward to 'em every year.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2694">Another year gone, eh? I'll drink to that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2695">My, my, my! I haven't seen you around before.
Could you be...&lt;playername&gt;?
Bingo! I just KNEW it!
I heard from Thomas that someone new was moving to
town, and he may or may not let your name slip, too.
Hm? Me? Oh, where ARE my manners?
My name is Manna.
My husband Duke and I run this Vineyard. It's ever
so nice to meet you. We may be out in the boonies,
but the folks here are kind, so let us know if you're
ever in a bind. Ooh, I'm a poet! Oh, whoops.
Am I talking too much? I'm so sorry. Bad habit.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2696">Goodness gracious, great balls of cowpat! Is that for me?!
Oh, you're such a sweetheart!
Unlike a certain husband of mine...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2697">I can tell you right now exactly how this is all going
to shake down. Duke's completely forgotten it's my
birthday today and will come home after stuffing
his face at the Inn. Waking up in a bloated haze,
he'll forget how he got home and what he was doing.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2698">Then he'll finally be like, "Oh no! Yesterday was Manna's
birthday!"&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2699">He'll rush to the General Store, and even if
it's Tuesday--you know, when they're usually
closed--he'll beg Jeff:&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2700">"Give me anything here that would work
as a present, stat!"&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2701">"On the double! I need it by YESTERDAY, pal!
Chop chop!"&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2702">Or some such thing. And then he'll take that present,
saunter up to me like he's had it all along...
...and hand it over with a dopey smile on his face,
as if nothing had ever happened.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2703">What will I do with it, you ask?
Return it immediately, of course.
For a full refund.
Duke will have no clue what he even bought me,
so he won't notice if I don't have it anymore.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2704">Why, thank you! Do you always give such lovely gifts
to the townspeople? If you're going to give gifts,
you should give them out to everyone, you know.
Bad rumors will start circulating if you're only generous
with folks who are young, single, and ready to mingle.
Well, to be honest, everyone likes you enough that you
prooobably don't have to worry. But anyway, thank you.
I love it!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2705">Why, thank you.
You're surprisingly conscientious.
No, that wasn't a backhanded compliment.
It's a good thing! Truly! I live with a pushy,
insensitive oaf of a man like Duke, so...
When I encounter folks like you, I can't help but
compare them to my only frame of reference.
Anyway, thank you so much.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2706">Thank you. Hmmm, yes... Are you making sure to tailor
your gifts to each of your neighbors' preferences?
You can't just give ANY old thing as a gift. That's why
you need to experiment and gauge the recipients'
reactions. They'll be too shy to answer truthfully
if you ask outright, but they're all honest people,
so watch their faces...and that should make their
true feelings clear. Take me right now, for instance.
This gift? It's...okay.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2707">My, my, my, now THIS is a problem.
I don't like this at all.
Of course, I'm not about to look a gift horse--or
whatever this is--in the mouth since it came from
you, but... I would really prefer to receive something
that doesn't offend at least three of my senses,
you know?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2708">My, my, my. Care to explain what THIS is? I'll pull up
a chair, so go ahead and prepare your explanation.
I'm waiting.
Now, I'm not about to REFUSE it, since it's coming from
you, but other folks would no doubt be furious over
this. Maybe you don't know this, but folks around
here are fairly strait-laced, so be careful with pranks
like this, hm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2709">Ahahaha! So, not only are you kind, but you're also
pure as the driven snow, I see.
Yes, yes, you're obviously taking a page out of Yu's book.
But he's usually trying to scare me, not impress me.
Even so, there aren't many small kids in this town,
so I give them more leeway to fool around because
it's cute.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2710">Wow, that's a hard no from me, thanks! Did you
purposefully choose to show me something I hate, or...?
Ah, yes, of course. You couldn't have avoided this because
you had no way of knowing. Well, now you do.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2711">Whaaat?! This is for me?
No no no, seriously! It's truly for me?
Where did you--? Ohhh, I see!
You had Saibara make it for you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2712">Guess he has more tricks up his sleeves than I thought.
Then maybe I'll also ask him to-- What's that? I need to
acquire a precious stone MYSELF to give to him?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2713">Don't you think he charges a liiittle much if all
he's doing is putting the thing together?
Goodness, it's downright disgusting how arrogant
some people can be about their own abilities.
His son has been begging Saibara to move in with him,
but he absolutely refuses to leave this town.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2714">But all's well that ends well, I suppose. At least his
grandson is living with him now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2715">Oh, my! Now THAT'S something right up my alley! Hm?
You're giving it to me?
Yesss! I'm tickled pink. Thank you.
I never DREAMED someone would give me such
a wonderful gift.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2716">Oh, my! Is that for me?
You're an odd duck, aren't you?
I work at a Vineyard, so I use my nose to distinguish
the scent of good grapes. Thus, I only use perfume
when I go out. But I DO love this fragrance.
If you were a suave, rugged bachelor,
my heart points would have maxed out just now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2717">Oh, my! Is that for me?
You're an odd duck, aren't you?
I work at a Vineyard, so I use my nose to distinguish
the scent of good grapes.
Thus, I only use perfume when I go out.
But I DO love this fragrance.
Mm-mm-mmm! To die for. ♪&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2718">Oh, do you cook much, by any chance?
I'll teach you how to make Mashed Potatoes.
Are you ready? You'll need to memorize this.
If you want to fetch something to write the recipe
down on, that would be best. Go ahead, I'll wait.
...Hm? Do *I* have something? Oh, no, no.
I love to talk, so I'll just tell you, all right?
The main ingredients are Potatoes, Butter, and Milk.
You'll also need a Pot, a Rolling Pin, and an Oven!
Oh, and Seasonings, too. Heat the Potatoes in the Oven,
crush them, and then mix them with the Butter and Milk.
Are you sure you can remember all this without writing
it down? ...No, I'm not making fun of you.
Perish the thought! It's just that I said it so fast,
I even surprised myself.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2719">Oh, NO you didn't! Mm-mm!
...Aha. I see what's going on here.
So, tell me. Who's the lucky so-and-so?
Someone in this town, I assume? Right?
Goodness, I simply CANNOT believe I hadn't caught wind
of this sooner. Well, I suppose since you never breathed
a word of it to me, I had absolutely no way of knowing.
Speaking of which, are you trying for some kind
of...cool cucumber vibe? You never actually SAY anything.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2720">Listen to this, &lt;playername&gt;.
Our daughter has started contacting us once
a week, all on her own. Until now, it was always us
trying to force some sort of communication out of her.
This is all thanks to Sasha having a word with her,
I'm sure. Oh, it is SO good to have friends in your
corner.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2721">Oh, my! Hello, hello, hello. ♪
How is &lt;childname&gt; doing, hmm?
You seem to be gone quite a lot.
Do you think children just sort of raise themselves
without supervision? I suppose that's one approach
you could take to parenting.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2722">After all, even if the parents DO stick around, the child
could one day up and skip town, like ours did.
Children do whatever they please without a second
thought as to how it affects their parents, you know.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2723">You'll be fine, &lt;playername&gt;.
With Cliff as your husband, &lt;childname&gt; is bound
to be happy. I hope you'll keep taking good care
of Cliff--and &lt;childname&gt; too, of course.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2724">I haven't given up on Adge, either.
I'm sure she'll come back home someday.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2725">My, what a coincidence!
Fancy running into you here.
How's Cliff?
What's he like at home, I wonder?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2726">He's always been so overly considerate towards us that
he ends up hiding how he really feels.
Duke and I were just talking about that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2727">I'm sure he's comfortable enough to let his hair
down around you--not that he has a ton.
Do you ever get into fights? It's best NOT to fight,
of course, but there's something a little eerie about
couples who NEVER squabble, you know?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2728">Oh dear, there I go again, off on another rant.
Me and my big mouth!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2729">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;. Hello there. How's the farm?
Is it-- Are you-- Er. Slow down, Manna.
One thought at a time.
You know, to be honest, I'm actually heading to the
Plaza right now, so I don't have time to chat. Sorry.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2730">I decided to quit going to the Plaza to gossip on
Saturdays. I know, who am I and what have I done
with Manna? But it's much more fun chatting with
Duke and Cliff at the Inn!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2731">Oh, dear. I wonder if this'll keep up all day long. It's like
I've got my own personal raincloud following me!
I mean, I'm not making a groundbreaking statement here,
but I can't be cooped up in the house all day.
I'd go stir-crazy. No matter who I talk with on
days like this, everyone spaces out. We have
a dire shortage of good listeners.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2732">Apparently, Cliff likes going to hear Carter proselytize
at Church. Why in the world do you think that is?
Personally, I can't understand a word that comes
out of Carter's mouth.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2733">He's apparently got a way of really captivating an
audience, but I'm not so sure...
In any case, Church doesn't exactly encourage ME to talk
much, so I want to get it all out here while I still can.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2734">I'm going to Anna's house right now. Sasha is always
rushing me out the door, and Lillia has no patience for me,
you know. Anna, on the other hand, always seems to look
forward to my visits. There isn't anyone else like her in
this town, so she's one of my favorite people to chat with.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2735">Oh, is it that late already?
Doesn't it feel like the days fly by?
I swear, I blink and suddenly there's no time left for me
to have a leisurely chat with Duke.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2736">Oh, my. You're up early, &lt;playername&gt;.
I suppose you can't very well sleep in when you work
on a farm. Hmmm? You sometimes do anyway?!
Heavens to homesteading, &lt;playername&gt;... No, no.
I suppose that might be for the best in the end.
After all, being TOO eager can backfire on you every
so often. Trust me. I know from experience.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2737">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;. You're still here?
Well, as long as we're on the subject, you know who
ELSE is an eager beaver? Ellen's granddaughter, Elly. 
She's an angel, but...how should I put this? She works too
hard for someone her age, on top of trying to raise Yu.
I feel so sorry for her!
I notice Yu crying by himself a lot, too.
They both have it so hard, poor things.
Don't you think that's sad, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2738">Oh, my! Thanks.
I know I don't talk to you much, &lt;playername&gt;,
so it might be weird bringing this up, but...
My daughter left me and this town behind, you know.
Poof, just like that. And to top it all off, Duke--
Duke's my husband, in case you didn't know. Anyway, he
goes out drinking every night, leaving me all alone.&lt;wait&gt; </Entry>
  <Entry Index="2739">To be honest, I've been lonely. That's why I try to talk
to people as much as I can, just to take my mind off it.
But the pain of not having your child around...
It really can't be expressed in words. If she'd gone
off to be someone's bride, that would be one thing, but...
Oh, speaking of which, you came here on your own too,
right, &lt;playername&gt;? Why'd you do that, anyway?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2740">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;!
Question: do you talk to Kai a lot?
When he first came to this town, he was just a teenager,
you know. He had Gotts--that's the old carpenter who
lives on the mountain, just so you know--build him
a small house. And up it went, smack dab in the middle
of Mineral Beach.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2741">And then, the very next day--get this--Kai painted
the house this tacky white color! We all thought he
was SO odd. There was a big stir when Carter came
to town too, but Kai's way of talking really got under the
other men's skin. If I said so much as a single kind word
about Kai, I'd never hear the end of it from Duke!
I tell you, men take pride in the most meaningless things...
Who cares how someone talks?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2742">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;. How's the farm?
Speaking of farms, the youngest over at Yodel Ranch left
quite a while back, just like our daughter did.
Mind you, Mugi is a lot older than us, and all alone, too.
And to top it all off, after ten whole years, Joanna
finally-- Oh, that's Mugi's daughter, for the record.
Anyway, Joanna finally came back, but with a little girl in
tow! If I were Mugi, I'd have been flabbergasted!
What's more, immediately after that, Joanna uproots
herself once again and leaves Mineral Town in the dust.
Here's the kicker to the whole story: that little girl
Joanna brought? Our very own Mei. I feel so sorry
for her.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2743">Mugi has it hard too, you know.
To this very day, he hasn't seen hide nor hair of Joanna.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Mugi says that even if Joanna comes back for Mei, he'll
refuse to let her take Mei away. Good for him, I say.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I may not have any business chiming in as an outsider, but
my heart just breaks for poor Mugi and Mei!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2744">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;. How's the farm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2745">By the by, you don't know anything about Rod,
do you, &lt;playername&gt;? He's Lillia's husband,
and the one who came to Mineral Town with that
shipper, Zack. They met on the road, and when Rod
heard that Zack had no relatives and no job, he offered
him free room and board. After a while, Zack found work
as a shipper, and the rest is history. You know, before
Zack arrived, a boat would only come to town once
a month. He's been a real asset to the community.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2746">But Lillia is so nice to Zack that he seems to have fallen
head over heels for her. Except she's the wife of the guy
who saved him. He won't give up, but he can't make
a move, either. It's really quite sad. And Lillia, bless her
heart, is so flaky that she doesn't have the first clue how
Zack feels. Me? No, no, I could never tell her. I try not to
rock the boat as much as possible, you know.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2747">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;. Hello there.
I'm chatting with Anna right now.
Apparently, the place where Anna lived before coming
here almost brushes shoulders with where my daughter
is now. Doesn't that just make you so curious?
I wonder what kind of life she's living.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2748">Anna makes such decadent desserts!
I always look forward to visiting her on Saturdays.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2749">Oh, oh, listen to this!
Today I just happened to overhear that...did... And THEN...
So SHE said... Can you believe it?!
Doesn't that just boggle your mind?!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2750">...Mm.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2751">Yes! You said it!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2752">Oh, perish the thought! No, no, no. They're obviously...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2753">Why, you ask?
Well, let me tell you...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2754">Yes, exactly. I mean, I've never heard of such a thing, and...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2755">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;. Hello there.
What's new? Hear any interesting rumors?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2756">Listen to this! Duke racked up ANOTHER tab at the
General Store! And for 5,000G, no less!
What in the world did he buy that he kept completely
secret from me?!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2757">And what sort of racket is Jeff running in the first
place? I'M the one who pays here. I wonder if
it can even be returned? And you know what
I heard from Dudley the other day?
That Duke calls Adge basically every day.
If he's going to spend that much on long-distance
phone calls, he may as well go to see her.
I mean, good grief.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2758">Oh, hello, &lt;playername&gt;.
Is &lt;childname&gt; sleeping?
Once &lt;childname&gt; gets bigger, we can all have
a meal together here. Wouldn't that be nice?
Come to think of it, don't you think Cliff looks much
happier now? Well, he IS a father now, after all.
I suppose it's only natural he'd light up.
Duke used to look exactly like that back when Adge
was first born.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2759">Now that &lt;childname&gt; is here, I suppose that
makes me a grandma.
It's such a strange feeling.
Huh? You're surprised I feel that way?
Regardless of ancestry, I think of you and
&lt;childname&gt; as family.
Don't you forget that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2760">Oh, hello, &lt;playername&gt;.
Are you working right now?
You're welcome to join us, if you like.
I understand that you're busy, but it won't kill you to
spend some time with your family every now and then.
I won't force you, though.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2761">I think of you as my daughter, &lt;playername&gt;.
I have another daughter too, of course, which makes you
her sister! If she ever comes back, I hope you two get
along.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2762">I think of you as my son, &lt;playername&gt;.
I have a daughter too, of course, which makes you her
brother! If she ever comes back, I hope you two get along.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2763">Hello there, &lt;playername&gt;.
Now that Cliff is with us, we've started coming to the
Inn on Saturdays to have weekly meals together.
After we finish eating, we always go to the Church.
Aren't we the spitting image of a real family? Hahaha.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2764">Duke has been so much happier since Cliff arrived.
The same goes for me, of course, but...
Days like this remind me of when Adge was around.
Eating out with the family... Aah, it takes me back.
Cliff is such a good guy that I can't help but fuss over
him, you know.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2765">Oh, you're here too, &lt;playername&gt;?
What about &lt;childname&gt;?
Establishing healthy habits should be a priority, both for
you and your family. Kids deserve the chance to be kids.
You should bring &lt;childname&gt; here sometime.
Carter said he wants to see mini-Cliff too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2766">Ever since &lt;childname&gt; was born, Duke and
I haven't been fighting as much. It's like his prickly
exterior has all but melted away. I suppose you
aren't at that point in your relationship yet.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2767">Cliff certainly is fond of Carter.
Because Carter supported him the most when he first
arrived in town, Cliff goes to Church every week
without fail. I've heard him speak a number of times
now, and he's a pretty fascinating man.
Have you heard his sermons, &lt;playername&gt;?
Churches are only as good as their priests,
and we lucked out.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2768">If a person puts their mind to it, they can become
whoever and whatever their heart desires.
So much has changed since I met Cliff.
My worldview, my lifestyle...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2769">Cliff is such a serious guy. I've decided not to pry into
his past and let him speak for himself instead.
It broke my heart when I heard from Carter how
terribly hurt Cliff was and how often he came to Church.
I want to try and be a surrogate mother to him.
It's the least I can do. Duke told me that if Cliff says he
likes the Vineyard, then he's thinking about taking him in.
I'm sure Duke still loves our daughter more than
anything, but... I also feel like life can't continue the
way it has been. We've stagnated. And I've had enough.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2770">You have to be quiet in Church, you know.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2771">Do you know that girl named Jennifer? She lives at the
Inn, but she's a bit of an oddball, let me tell you.
Apparently, she used to be an aristocrat or something,
but she got tired of having her life dictated and ran
away. To be honest--and this is just me--I would've been
perfectly happy living a life of wealth and luxury. Just
saying... This conversation reminds me of my daughter,
actually. I wonder what she's doing right now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2772">Hey, did you know that Brandon is apparently a famous
artist? It turns out that there are good art-making
materials in the mountains around here. That's why
he came to town. The story goes that Gotts found him
collapsed in the mountains. Collapsed! Can you
imagine? One thing led to another, and now he's
freeloading at Gotts' mountain shack. But what kind
of art does he even make? I'd like to see his work
sometime.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2773">That girl Jennifer says there's a Goddess living in the
mountain by this town. According to her, a bunch of
fairies live here too. Yeah, sure, Jen.
Talk about having a few screws loose.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2774">Have you seen any of Brandon's art, &lt;playername&gt;?
Word is, he's made quite a name for himself in the
art world. His pieces are very avant-garde, or so
I've heard. Something tells me his work would go
right over my head.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2775">You know about the Mochi Bonanza, don't you?
Of course you do, the town's abuzz about it. 
I can't help out much with the preparations,
but with the mochi-eating? You know I'll be there!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2776">Every time Derby season rolls around, Duke can't seem
to sit still. We've been together for years, but I still get a
kick out of it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2777">I enjoy watching the horses as much as everyone else in
this town, though! So I'll be going, too, of course.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2778">We've had some especially tasty morsels in Cooking
Exhibitions past. I'm sure this year's will be just as
scrumptious!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2779">"Do I have confidence in my culinary skill?" What kind of
question is that, silly? Of course I do!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2780">The Harvest Festival's in a few days! I'm still deciding
what kind of ingredients to bring!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2781">Well, &lt;playername&gt;, I've just GOT to know what
you'll be bringing to the Harvest Festival!
I'm sure you have plenty of produce from your
farm to share with us, hm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2782">Oh, goodness, another year gone already?
But I don't WANT to age another year...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2783">Aha, so you have brought it. Very good. Allow me to show
you my most superlative wares.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2784">Oh? Your Bag is full, I'm afraid. You'll have to sort that
out before you buy any of my wares.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

saved up a little more. At least 1,000,000G should do.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2799">Today's special item is...TA-DAAAH!
"&lt;string0&gt;."
It will cost you &lt;string1&gt;G.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2800">Aha. A most familiar item indeed.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If you have at least 1,000,000G to spare, I can show you
another of my wares.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2801">Will you buy this item?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2802">Yes! Money is no object!</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2803">Not at THAT price!</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2804">Thank you for your business.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2805">I see. A pity.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Bear in mind that the next time you drop by,
I may have a different item available for sale.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
So please, go ahead and bring me the exact same thing
again then.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2806">Oh ho! And on my birthday, too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2807">Great gilded goddess of gift-giving, this is a most valuable
item indeed! I will cherish it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2808">A present? For me?
Thank you. I shall keep it close.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2809">Erm, I'm afraid I'm...not particularly fond of this,
but I appreciate the thought nonetheless. Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2810">What manner of tasteless japery...?!
I've no need of something so worthless!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2811">Oh, what a precious little thing!
Hahahaha!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2812">YIKES! I'll kindly ask you to put some distance between
me and THAT, please!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2813">Oh ho! A quality item indeed, that.
Hm? It is a present for me?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Why, thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2814">Aah, now THIS is quite the treasure.
Hm? It is a present for me? Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2815">What a luxurious fragrance!
Why, if opulence had a scent...!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Hm? It is for me? How very kind.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2816">Aha, that's right. Today is the holiday wherein chocolate
is exchanged.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2817">A lovely feather, that. I'm sure it would fetch a handsome
price on the market.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Hm? It is a symbolic token exchanged during a marriage

  <Entry Index="2818">Word is that an unassuming little farm in Forgotten
Valley by the name of &lt;linkedfarmname&gt; is highly

  <Entry Index="2835">Erm, w-well... Your heart was certainly in

because I didn't think you capable of being so hurtful.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="2838">Erm, I'm sorry. I, ah...
I admit it! I'm scared of those!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2839">Wow! That's incredible.
What? It's a present for me?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Thank you. No, really. You're too kind.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2840">Wow! That's incredible.
And it's a present for me, you say?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2841">The young folk around here--Kai, Karen, and the

  <Entry Index="2843">&lt;playername&gt;, I imagine you must be busy enough
with work that finding time to cook for yourself is
difficult.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Why don't I teach you a simple recipe that you can whip
up quickly? Like, say...Fried Rice? Great! Listen closely.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's easy. First, you put some Oil in your Frying Pan. Then,
add an Egg and some Onigiri, and cook until they're done.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And there you have it: Fried Rice! See, I told you it was
an easy recipe.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2844">&lt;playername&gt;, you're getting married?
Congratulations! I'm jealous.

work. As always, I'm glad our town is so peaceful.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="2853">Hello there. How are you doing? Have you caught wind of
any strange or unusual activity?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Hahaha. No, I'm sure you haven't.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2854">All right, time to give today my all!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2855">Good morning.
It's time to face another day head-on!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2856">Every morning, I wake up excited to see the happy faces
of all the townsfolk. Do you think that makes me odd?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2857">Hello there, &lt;playername&gt;.
Are you taking a break too?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's important to close your eyes, breathe deeply, and
center yourself every so often. Stress takes a toll.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2858">Don't worry. Everyone knows that they can find me here
at this hour.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

Well, look at me turning redder than a bottle full
of holy sacrament. Thank you. I'm delighted.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2874">Thank you. Labor as I might in the realm of the divine,
I lack a true "job" here, so I feel blessed by such kindness.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2875">Thank you. This is a true blessing.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2876">A boon, to be sure. Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2877">I'll...take it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2878">My stars and holy garters...
Well, this is awkward. I'm not entirely sure why you
would give this to me.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I will...think it over for a while.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2879">Ah! Marvelous.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2880">I spurn such things, actually.
Perhaps it stems from some childhood trauma
I would just as soon forget.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2881">Thank you very much. Are you sure?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I get the feeling that this is no everyday object.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2882">Thank you very much.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm not sure I'll be able to get any use out of it,
admittedly, but...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I would be rude to refuse your kindness.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2883">Aha! So that's where that heavenly fragrance was
wafting from. I most gratefully accept.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2884">I'll teach you how to make a treat that I often fix for the
children.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's quite a straightforward recipe--no pen or paper
required, I'd reckon. You simply need Strawberries
and Milk.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You put those in a Mixer, blend them together,
and in a blink of an eye, it's done.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Hm? You'd rather just BUY some Strawberry Milk?
But creating it yourself is far more satisfying.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2885">Oh, what auspicious news!
Shall I pray that all goes well?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2886">Evidently, there's a couple that lives on a farm

creature lives in the forest at Forgotten Valley.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2888">The rumor goes on to say that it used to be human long,

I wonder?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2889">A part-time job at the Vineyard, hm?
That sounds lovely.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2890">I appreciate you telling me, but if it wouldn't be too much
trouble, might you alert Cliff to the opportunity instead?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
He DID say he was looking for a job, if I'm not mistaken.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2891">A blessed day to you.
This is the Church.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
A priest I may be, but only in title.
I don't really do anything around here.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Why, you ask? Because the meaning of "happiness"
I believe in has become something altogether
unrecognizable.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2892">Yet despite my own circumstances, I will not reject any
who come to me in search of salvation.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The Church also has a Confessional, which is at your
disposal should you ever wish to unburden yourself.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2893">Do you think that when we create graves, the dead
stay in them forever? I ask, but in truth, none can say.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Still, we cling to our rituals, likely because we fear
forgetting that which has lost physical form.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="2906">Once upon a time, in a land not unlike our own, there was
a normal family. The kind one would find anywhere.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2907">A father, mother, and their juvenile son all lived together
in blissful harmony.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
One day, the mother succumbed to a virulent illness
and suddenly passed away.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
As the grief-stricken father stood over his late wife,
the little boy came up to him, and asked:&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
"What happened to Mom?"
The boy curiously peered at his dearly departed mother's
unblinking face.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The father, unsure what to say, desperately explained
that she had fallen into a deep sleep.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2908">Upon hearing that, the boy was greatly troubled.
He told his father:&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
"Then please, Dad. Use all of my allowance and buy a big
alarm clock to wake her up."&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2909">What do you think of that?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2910">That was when the father learned that the diluted
words adults use to avoid speaking of death...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

I bid you a blessed day.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2912">Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there lived
a beautiful girl.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Her hair was black as ebony, her skin as white as snow,
and her lips as red as blood.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The girl's mother, a witch, had in her possession
a magical mirror. One day, she asked the mirror:&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2913">"Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them
all?" The mirror replied:&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
"Of course, it is you, my queen."
The witch smirked in satisfaction.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2914">If the mirror had said any name but her own, she would
have sent her servants to expunge them from the earth.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And if the servants were to fail in their solemn duty, she
would poison that person with her own two hands.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2915">In truth, the mirror knew that the ebony-haired girl was
the fairest of them all, but feared the price of honesty.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And so, it lied.
Everyone lived happily ever after.
The end.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2916">What do you think?
That story is called "Snow-White Lies." Mull that over
until we next meet.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2917">This is a true story that takes place before I became
a priest.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Once, I was penniless and lived out my days in a small
apartment.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
From my apartment window, when the curtains were
drawn, I could see into the building right across from
mine.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The room I could see was just as gloomy as mine.
Eventually, I learned that a married couple lived there.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2918">The wife would leave for work each day while the
husband remained behind. I assumed he was some
sort of artist.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
At least, that's what I thought at first, until I noticed
something odd.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2919">Whenever I looked into their living space, he was always
squatting in the exact same position.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
From then on, I found myself paying much more attention
to that room across the way.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The husband remained in the exact same place and
posture from when the curtains opened to when they
closed at night.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But he was not motionless. I could see him talking and
moving his head.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Fixated upon this man I had never met, I became
desperate to learn the reason why.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
One day, a small fire broke out in that apartment.
My gaze hovered over their open window.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And what did I find but the husband squatting in his usual
place, a troubled expression etched upon his face.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I knew the wife had left for the day, so I scrambled over
to help the husband.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
By the time I arrived, the room was filled with smoke,
but I could see him turning toward me.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Running to his side, I laid my hands upon him,
ready to forcibly drag him out...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...but despite his weedy appearance--surely he would
be as light as paper, I told myself--his body was
stone-heavy.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
That was when my eyes traveled downward...and saw
four hands jutting from the floor, holding him in place.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2920">"Aaaaaagh!"&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2921">Phew... Even now, remembering the horror I felt in that
moment still gives me goosebumps.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2922">Cliff has left the town.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
We are all the masters of our own destinies. He has to

Unfortunately, that is one problem I cannot help with.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

Incidentally, that's where I sleep.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2938">Well, "sleep" may not be the right word...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2939">Shall I tell you why I do so little spiritual outreach
in this town?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2940">Because the townspeople live according to the Goddess'
teachings without even realizing it.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
There is nothing for me to teach.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2941">And yet here I am, living among them.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Which is why I must try to find some other,
higher purpose for my life.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2942">Everyone says graveyards are eerie, but I beg to differ.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
This is a place where people leave their treasured
memories--happy memories of days long past...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2943">Have you met the Nature Sprites yet?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
They don't often reveal themselves.
Only those pure in heart and earnest in spirit
are able to see them.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2944">Is there anything that's been weighing on your mind
recently?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If you wish to unburden yourself, feel free to visit the
Confessional anytime. I pledge to listen without judgment.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2945">Everyone in this town is so kind.
Even a pseudo-mendicant like me can manage to get by
thanks to them.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2946">The Mochi Bonanza is upon us once again. It's a truly
joyous occasion. I hope we'll see you there, as well.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2947">What kinds of meals will this year's Cooking Exhibition
bring us, I wonder?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I cannot partake, but the thought is certainly
entertaining.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2948">The Cooking Exhibition takes place tomorrow.
I cannot help but wonder whose cuisine will
reign supreme this year...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2949">Might you be participating in this year's Moo-Moo
Festival, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2950">It will be a pleasure to watch tomorrow's Moo-Moo
Festival. The cows there never cease to impress me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2951">I pray you'll take part in this year's Concert with us.
You would be a wonderful addition to our group.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2952">I expect a delightful performance at tomorrow's Concert.
Everyone's been practicing so diligently.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2953">I must be sure to have enough ingredients on hand...
The Harvest Festival draws near, after all!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2954">Have you thought about what you'd like to add to our
Harvest Festival hodgepodge, &lt;playername&gt;? As a
farmer, I'm sure you have much to choose from.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2955">Derby season is upon us once again. We are blessed to be
able to watch such majestic horses compete.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2956">Tomorrow is the Derby, is it not? I wish all the
participants a good race. I shall be cheering them on
with the rest of the town!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2957">Tomorrow, we'll all be feasting on soba. Let us reflect on
our progress and growth as the year comes to a close.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

Y'know? Come to think of it, I've never seen you wear

Any reason for that, or...?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2978">Hey, thanks! I know it takes all types to make the world

  <Entry Index="2992">YOOO. Whoa whoa whoa. Hold it.

  <Entry Index="2999">Me...a dad! I still can't picture it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3000">&lt;nickname&gt;, how are you feeling?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Lemme know if you need me to carry anything heavy or
get somethin' from the top shelf. That's why I'm here.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3001">I asked Doc what kindsa stuff I should be handlin' for
your sake. I mean, I'm a dad now! I've gotta act like one!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3002">Is that a little baby bump I'm startin' to see?
Mini-Kai is gettin' bigger every day.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3003">I'm gonna do everything I can.
For both of you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3004">According to Doc, our baby will probably be born
tomorrow.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3005">He said he and Elly will be coming by, just in case.
How about you just kick back and rest for today?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3006">Man, babies have teeny hands. I love when they reach out
and grab hold of my pinky finger. It's so cute!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3007">I wonder who &lt;childname&gt; takes after most...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3008">Hm... Hmmm... HMMMMM...
...Okay, maybe I'm jumpin' the gun juuust a little.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3009">Hey, what do you think &lt;childname&gt; will wanna be
as a grown-up?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3010">No matter what path our kid chooses to walk,
I hope it's a happy one. I'll do my best to make
sure of that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3011">Hmm, I'm thinking we'll see &lt;childname&gt; start
walkin' soon. I've seen the little cutie almost
stand up a few times now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3012">As soon as Operation Standing Baby is a success,
let's take 'em around the farm--oh, and out
to the beach, too!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3013">Man, kids shoot up so fast! At this rate, I'm gonna turn
around and find myself livin' with another grown-up.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3014">I'm always thinkin' about what I can do to be the best
dad for our kid at every stage of parenting.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3015">Hey, is it me, or is &lt;childname&gt; starting to talk?
Can't really make out any words yet, but the effort's
there.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3016">I get the feeling that &lt;childname&gt; understands me,
but maybe not vice versa. Don'tcha think,
&lt;nickname&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3017">...Hmm...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3018">Yeah? What?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3019">Hey, uh, is it me, or have you been givin' me the cold
shoulder lately?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3020">C'mon, you're bein' colder than an off-season breeze at
the Beach Cafe! We've barely talked in...how long, now?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3021">&lt;nickname&gt;...
Do you hate me or something now?
What'd I do?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3022">Oh, phew. For a minute there, I was starting to think you
were avoiding me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3023">Morning, &lt;nickname&gt;.
What's the plan for today?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I bet you've got a ton of stuff you've gotta do around
the farm.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3024">Hm? How's the Beach Cafe doing?
Why don't you drop on by and find out?
Hint: it's going just fine.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3025">Yo. Welcome home, &lt;nickname&gt;.
Headed back out to work some more?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3026">Take it from me: you don't have to work THAT hard.
Going at your own speed and taking it easy is totally
valid.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3027">Morning, &lt;nickname&gt;! Y'know, it's pretty nice
watchin' the sun come up on a farm.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3028">I've always loved summer best, but now I'm startin' to see
how other seasons are pretty cool in their own ways.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3029">Welcome home, &lt;nickname&gt;.
Working late again, I see.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3030">If you ever feel bushed, come on over to the Beach Cafe
for a snack. I'll hafta charge you regular price, though.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3031">Morning, &lt;nickname&gt;. ∀
I'll do my best out there today if you promise
to do the same. Deal?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3032">Yep, my wanderin' days are over.
I just can't see myself living without you anymore,
&lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3033">Yo, &lt;nickname&gt;. You're back.
How was your day? Anything cool happen?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3034">We're family now, so you can tell me anything. I'm not
really into keeping secrets and stuff. Let's be open.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3035">Yo. What's up?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3036">Dude, this Inn is great. It's cheap and the food's killer.
There's no place like it in any other town I've been to.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I look forward to staying here every year.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3037">Popuri is a really sweet girl. She's kind and thoughtful
and always perky.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3038">Now, if only we could avoid her friggin' nag of a big bro...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3039">Man, Popuri's big bro is a royal pain in the butt. The
heck's that dude's problem?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3040">He nitpicks and complains about every. Little. Thing. I get
real sick of it, real fast.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3041">*sigh*&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3042">Ugh. YOU try sitting through one of Rick's endless
tirades sometime.
You'll wanna gnaw your own leg off.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3043">If the dude's in love with me or something, I wish he'd just
come out and say it insteada bullying me like a kid.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3044">Maaan, what a pain.
He's so dang serious, too...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3045">Sheesh. I still don't get why Popuri has to be that jealous.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I guess there's a difference between dodging Rick to see
each other once a year and being together year-round.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3046">You'd think staying here at the Inn on my own would
make things easier, right?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Wrong. Rick comes here too. He'll get a few drinks
downstairs, get tipsy... And then the claws REALLY come
out. Ugh.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3047">Yo, &lt;playername&gt;. What's up?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3048">Man, I can hardly believe we're about to be married.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I wonder what you'll look like all decked out in a fancy
wedding dress? I can't even imagine it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3049">Man, I can hardly believe we're about to be married.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I wonder what you'll look like all decked out in a fancy
tuxedo? I can't even imagine it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3050">Yo! How's the farm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3051">All work and no play makes for a dull &lt;playername&gt;,
y'know. How 'bout you take a break and hang out here
for a bit?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3052">Yo! How's it going?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3053">I know I'm only here during summer, but that's even more
reason for us to hang out sometime. How 'bout it?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It'd be pretty cool if we, y'know, got dinner here together
or something. Juuust sayin'.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3054">Yo, &lt;playername&gt;.
Have you ever had the food here?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3055">Thinking about it, this place is kinda like my business rival
or whatever.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Maaan, how come I'm not getting more customers?
My food is definitely up to snuff, so... Hmm.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3056">Hm? Ah! Yo, &lt;playername&gt;!
Here to throw a few back?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3057">You might not think it, but I'm pretty good at holding my
drinks. Wine's right up my alley. Betcha didn't know that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3058">Yo, &lt;playername&gt;. How's the farm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3059">Man, &lt;playername&gt;, you've really got it together.
Me? I don't. Not at all.
My Cafe's in rough shape and so am I.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3060">Yo, &lt;playername&gt;. Working hard?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3061">I've always run my Cafe kinda by the seat of my pants,
but watching you has made me wanna put more effort
into it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3062">Yo, &lt;playername&gt;. What's shakin'?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3063">It's weird. Lately, I've found myself kinda...looking out for
you around town. I wonder why.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I've never felt like this before.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3064">Come by my Cafe sometime.
I'll roll out the red carpet for ya!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3065">I'm only here during summer, y'know. Hangin' with me
is a special, limited-time experience!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3066">Ah! &lt;nickname&gt;, you sure you should be out
and about?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3067">When I first found out, I was like, "WHOA," but now that
I'm gonna be a dad, I've gotta get my crap together.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3068">Yo, &lt;nickname&gt;. How's &lt;childname&gt; doing?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3069">Me, raising a kid... Who'da thunk it?
I never really saw it as my thing, but now that I'm knee-
deep, it's not so bad.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I used to think families and homes and stuff were nothing
but shackles, but I'm realizing that was just bias on my
part.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3070">Sorry. I'm not in the mood to talk to you right now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3071">Dude, just leave me alone!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3072">Ah. &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3073">Could you give me some space right now? I'm thinking
some stuff over.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3074">Yo, &lt;nickname&gt;.
Come to watch the waves roll in too?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3075">The waters here are so vivid and clear.
I find myself losing track of time whenever I stare out
to sea.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3076">Man, living together with you is great,
&lt;nickname&gt;. Every day is full of cool new
discoveries--about you, about US...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3077">I've got a ton of respect for you, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3078">Man, I've GOTTA boost business at my Cafe somehow.
I don't wanna be outdone on the money front forever,
y'know.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3079">Dude, I am so glad I got to marry you, 
&lt;nickname&gt;. ∀  You're the pineAPPLE of my eye.
Heh.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Don't worry. I'll be home every night before it gets
too late. Promise.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3080">Dude, I am so glad I got to marry you, 
&lt;nickname&gt;. ∀  You're the pineAPPLE of my eye.
Heh.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Don't worry. I'll be home every night before it gets
too late. Promise.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3081">Marriage is cool, but it's not, like, the end-all, be-all
of relationships. What d'you think, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3082">I s'pose it means something different to everyone.
If we both give it our best, I'm sure it'll work out
for us, eh?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3083">Yo, &lt;playername&gt;. How's it going? Everything okay
on the farm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3084">Sometimes, I have to wonder if marriage just isn't
my bag.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Don't get me wrong--I don't regret it or anything,
but I can't help myself from thinking, y'know?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3085">It feels like time passes at more of a crawl here than it
does in the town where I live.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3086">Yo! What's up?
Sorry, but I'm closed at the moment.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Relax and take it easy with me, eh?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3087">Aaah. The sea breeze here's like a snack for the soul.
Maybe I'll stay for more than just summer one of these
years.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3088">What're YOU here for? If you don't need anything,
just get out, okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3089">Please.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3090">Hey, uh, what would you do if I said I wanted to leave
Mineral Town?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3091">I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
Don't take it seriously, okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3092">Welcome! Here for some grub?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3093">Dude, are you seriously my only customer,
&lt;nickname&gt;? Uh...I think my Cafe might be in
trouble.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3094">Welcome, &lt;nickname&gt;. Something up?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3095">Y'know, I was thinking... Wouldn't it be kinda cool to live
here at the Beach Cafe?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Personally, I'm happy no matter where I put down roots,
as long as I'm with you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3096">Yo, &lt;nickname&gt;. ∀
Welcome. I'm glad to see you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3097">Yo, &lt;nickname&gt;. ∀
Welcome. I'm glad to see you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3098">My menu's always the same. I DID think about adding
dishes from other seasons, but since this is a Beach Cafe,
well...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3099">Ah! Yo, &lt;playername&gt;. Welcome!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3100">Hm? Where are the other customers? Funny you should
ask... Not many other people drop by. But meh, I don't let
it bug me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3101">Yo! Welcome, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3102">Come on in and hang out for a bit.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3103">Yo! How's it going?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3104">It's friggin' blazin' out there, so don't push your luck with
the heat, ya hear me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3105">Yo, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3106">Y'know, nothing much ever happens here, so it's kiiinda
boring. But the people sure are nice!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3107">Maaan, I'm getting, like, no customer traffic at all.
Maybe I should follow your example and take up
farming.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3108">Just kidding! I already know I'm not cut out for that
stuff. I don't have the willpower you do,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3109">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;... D'you think you're gonna stay in
this town forever?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Why do I ask? Oh, no reason.
Just got curious, that's all.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3110">There are some other really nice places out there,
y'know. You should travel more. Really get a feel for
the world.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3111">I love summer, so as soon as the season's over here,
I move on to the next town where summer's blazin'.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3112">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;, do YOU like summer? If you didn't
have that farm tying you down, I'd take you to all kindsa
places.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3113">Yo, &lt;playername&gt;. Maaan, you're practically my only
customer, aren't you? It's kinda sad...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3114">I mean, it's not great business-wise, but I kinda like having
only you around. No, seriously. I do.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3115">Yo. Welcome, &lt;playername&gt;.
Farm life treatin' you right?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Me? Well, the Cafe's dead as usual, but it's nice to be
able to take it easy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3116">Y'know, I'm starting to wanna hang around this town
more. It's just boring when you aren't around.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3117">I'm gonna head out to work.
I'll be back before it gets too late.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3118">Yo. What's up? Need something?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3119">Welp, that's another day of hard work and good fun in
the bag.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3120">Business is, well... It's not much better than usual.
But it's all good. Things'll work out in the end.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3121">I'd better get to work. See you tonight.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3122">Hey, whoa. You're gonna make me late to work.
I promise I'll be home on time tonight, okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3123">Yo. Evenin'! You wrapping up work for the day too,
&lt;nickname&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3124">When you think of work as...well, work, it somehow feels
more tiring. Hm? Have I not been doing that all along?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Well... Kinda yes, kinda no? I guess it's the weight of
responsibility that I'm noticing more these days.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3125">I've gotta take off.
Watch things while I'm gone, 'kay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3126">It's such an awesome feeling to know that someone will
be waiting for me when I come home.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3127">Yo, &lt;nickname&gt;. Didja come to pick me up from
work? Aw, you didn't have to. ♪&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3128">I mean, yeah, it's kinda embarrassing, but it DOES make
me happy...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3129">Um, s-so, uh, I'm taking off... Man, it feels weird saying
that to someone.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3130">There's just something about family that makes me all
warm 'n fuzzy. Heck, just saying the word makes my
heart race!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3131">Hey, uh... Babe, I-I'm home...
Geez, that feels so weird to say.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3132">I'm still learning the ropes with the whole husband thing.
Gotta remember how to talk like one! Haha.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3133">Welp, I'm off to the Beach Cafe!
I'll be back later tonight. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3134">Welp, I'm off to the Beach Cafe!
I'll be back later tonight. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3135">Man, it feels so weird heading out like I'm going to an
office or something.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3136">I was just getting ready to head home. You finished with
work for the day too, &lt;nickname&gt;? ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3137">I was just getting ready to head home. You finished with
work for the day too, &lt;nickname&gt;? ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3138">It's nice to have a house to go home to,
but the Beach Cafe is my home too.
Ah well. I'll get used to it eventually.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3139">Haha! It's finally my season to shine! Hope I'll be seein'
you at the Fetch Fest, &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3140">I'm so stoked for tomorrow's Fetch Fest! Beaches have
been my stomping grounds for as long as I can remember.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3141">I am ALWAYS here for a good fireworks show!
Let's make some noise tomorrow!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3142">Moonlight Night, huh...? Man, that's actually kind of a
bummer for me... Makes it feel like summer's officially
over.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3143">Hm? Haven't seen you before.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Huh. So you're the new owner of that farm? I'm Gray.
Nice to meet you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
There's absolutely nothing around here. You...do know
that, right? Don't tell me you're some kinda earth weirdo.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3144">Oh! Huh? Is this a birthday present?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
So you remembered, &lt;nickname&gt;. Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3145">Wh-Whoa! You just about scared me outta my boots
there. What's up?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Is this...a birthday present?
Wow, thanks. That's nice of you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3146">Heck yeah. That smells great. Thanks. 
I can't get enough of this stuff.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3147">Oh, thanks! Guess you know me well, huh?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm so glad I married you, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3148">Oh, thanks! Gotta say, it's nice to have friends who have
your back.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3149">Thanks, &lt;nickname&gt;. I wouldn't mind gettin'
another one of these sometime. Heh.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3150">Lucky me! Y'know, if you ever wanted to give me one of
these again sometime... Heh.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3151">Thanks, &lt;nickname&gt;. I'll take it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3152">Oh, thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3153">Nah. Pass. I thought you knew that wasn't my kinda thing,
&lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Well, now you do, I guess.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3154">Uh, I guess I'll take it, but just so you know, I'm not exactly
jumpin' up and down about it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3155">The heck's this, &lt;nickname&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Y'know, there's a line you shouldn't cross when it comes
to stupid pranks. You're startin' to tick me off.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3156">Okay, now you've REALLY got me heated. Knock this
crap off and stop messin' with me!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3157">Coming all this way to show me that...
You're friggin' cute, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3158">Coming all this way to show me that...
You're friggin' cute.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3159">Whoa! Get outta here with that, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3160">Whoa! Get outta here with that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3161">That's one of Grandpa's creations, right? Huh.
Thanks, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Actually, this'll encourage me to keep training until
I can make something this good. Or better, even.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3162">Grandpa made that, huh? Thanks. I'll take it. Maybe I'll
learn something from inspectin' his craftsmanship.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3163">Oh, &lt;nickname&gt;.
Wait, this isn't yours?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Thanks. I'll give it to my mom or something.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3164">Hey, that looks nice.
You're giving it to me?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Guess I'll give it to my mom or something.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3165">That's a pretty thoughtful present. You're smooth.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3166">Oh, perfume. If you don't want it, &lt;nickname&gt;,
I'll take it.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Thanks. I'll give it to my mom or something.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3167">Huh? Wait, &lt;nickname&gt;... I thought guys were
supposed to give chocolate today?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Well, guess I shouldn't complain. Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3168">W-Wait, is today...? Huh?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Uh, not sure exactly what's goin' on, but I'll take it
anyway. Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3169">Uhhh, I dunno what's goin' on, but...thanks?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3170">So you DID get me something.
Thanks. Really, I'm glad.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3171">Oh, hey. For me?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Thanks! Nice of you to do that even though I didn't get
YOU anything for White Day.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3172">Oh, you didn't have to return the favor. I'm glad you did,
though. Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3173">Whoa! L-Let's bring the heat down a notch. We're kinda
in public here.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3174">Who're you gonna give that to? I hope it works out
for you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3175">Y'know, you really shouldn't mess with people like that.
Not cool. Huh? You didn't mean it as a joke?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3176">Uhhh... Sorry, but I don't think I'm ready to take that step
with you yet.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3177">What? Somethin' on your mind?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3178">Yeaaah, no. If I cut into my training with a part-time job,
Grandpa'd chew me out somethin' fierce.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3179">Um... Tomorrow's Starlight Night.
I'm gonna be preppin' a feast, so...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Would you wanna have a party at your place,
&lt;playername&gt;? You've gotta be lonely all by
yourself, right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3180">Um... Tomorrow's Starlight Night.
I'm gonna be preppin' a feast, so...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Would you wanna have a party at your place,
&lt;playername&gt;? You've gotta be lonely all by
yourself, right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3181">Let's have Saibara over too.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3182">Huh? Grandpa? Y'know, you're right.
We should invite him too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3183">Cool. See you at the Forge after 6:00 PM tomorrow.
Just swing by when you're done working.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3184">Oh... Okay.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3185">Tomorrow's Starlight Night, so we're gonna have
a party. I've gotta put my blood, sweat, and tears
into a feast.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
No, not literally. I just meant that I've got a lotta work
to do. Make sure you come home hungry tomorrow, okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3186">There's a little baby inside you right now, huh?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3187">We've gotta do everything we can to keep 'em safe.
I wonder when the big day'll be?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3188">I'm gonna be a dad.
Get it together, Gray.
Get. It. Together.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3189">I wonder if the baby'll be a boy or a girl? Honestly, I don't
really care either way, so long as they're healthy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3190">Your belly's really starting to show.
It feels like it'll be any day now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3191">But don't push yourself, okay?
Take your work one step at a time.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3192">At the Clinic, they said the baby could be born tomorrow,
so Doctor and Elly will be hunkering down with us here.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3193">We'll finally be meeting our kid.
I wonder what kinda person they'll grow up to be?
Can't wait to find out.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3194">&lt;childname&gt; just cries, cries, cries all day and night,
huh? What should we do?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3195">Being a parent is tough. It's completely different from
what I imagined.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3196">You're so good at putting &lt;childname&gt; to bed,
&lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3197">Holding &lt;childname&gt; makes me feel like a newbie
smith holding his first hammer.
Like, "Why are you crying THIS time?"&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3198">It's looking like &lt;childname&gt; is almost ready to
stand. It could be any day now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3199">And talking'll come soon after that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3200">Now that &lt;childname&gt;'s big enough to stand up,
I wanna go somewhere as a family soon.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3201">Finally showing &lt;childname&gt; what the world looks
like outside these four walls is gonna be a real treat.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3202">I can mostly understand what &lt;childname&gt; is
saying now. I'm getting better at reading body language
and stuff too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3203">Maybe I'll try making some toys at the Forge.
I'm sure &lt;childname&gt; would love having
something Dad made himself.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3204">...
...
...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3205">Let's just be honest here. You don't care about me,
do you, &lt;nickname&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3206">...I just can't understand what's goin' through your head
recently, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3207">I know the farm is important, but I coulda sworn we
exchanged vows to spend time together and stuff. C'mon.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3208">Do you hate me now or something, &lt;nickname&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Be honest. I can take it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3209">We haven't been talking as much. This isn't how a
husband and wife are supposed to act.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3210">We haven't been talking as much. This isn't how husbands
are supposed to act.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3211">Oh, &lt;nickname&gt;. Morning. Living on a farm means
you rise with the sun, huh?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3212">The Forge doesn't open until later, so I'm not much
of a morning person.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3213">Welcome back. Are you done working?
Or are you gonna keep at it?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3214">It must be rough working so late.
Is that why you're so buff?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3215">Morning, &lt;nickname&gt;.
Work up a good sweat out there today.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3216">I'm not a master smith yet, but I'm getting there,
one step at a time.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I've gotta keep up with you, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3217">Welcome home. You wiped out after today?
Or are you still rarin' to go?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3218">Hey, be careful not to trip and hurt yourself if you're
gonna work through the night. Your tools holdin' up okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3219">Morning, &lt;nickname&gt;. ∀ How're you feeling today?
Catch enough z's?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3220">Before we got married, &lt;nickname&gt;, I never
imagined I'd be living on a farm like this. Life has a way...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3221">Before we got married, &lt;nickname&gt;, I never
imagined I'd be living on a farm. Life sure likes to take its
turns, doesn't it?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3222">Welcome home, &lt;nickname&gt;. ∀
The hustle never stops, eh?
Be careful out there when it gets dark.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3223">Compared to before we lived together, I don't have to
worry about you as much, since I'm never too far away.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3224">Compared to before we lived together, I don't have to
worry about you as much, since I'm never too far away.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3225">Huh? Fancy seeing you here, babe.
Were you workin' nearby?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3226">Try not to come home too late, okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3227">Ugh, I hate the countryside.
There's absolutely nothin' around.
Do you seriously like it here?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3228">Ugh, I've got way too much free time and nothin' to do
with it. I wanna go back to the city. Don't you?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

Been in a reading sorta mood lately.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3232">Can't believe it took me this long to realize how
interesting books could be.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3233">Apparently, Marie's a novelist.
Talk about amazing.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Knowing how hard she works on her novels makes ME
wanna work hard too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3234">Yo. You look like you're keepin' busy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3235">You think I'm happier recently, huh? Well, you ain't wrong.
It's almost like a fog has lifted, honestly.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm plannin' to put everything I've got into my smithing
work from here on out.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3236">Marie's different from other girls somehow.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's like...I want her to notice me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3237">Right now, my life is pretty much just work, read, sleep,
repeat. For some reason, though, I'm kinda into it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3238">Marie's dad is always telling me the most fascinating,
out-there stories.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3239">Reading is great and all, but smithing is my passion.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3240">Oh, hey, &lt;playername&gt;. The wedding's coming up
pretty soon, huh?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3241">Still can't really believe it's happening. I never thought
I'd get married before I'd mastered my craft.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

  <Entry Index="3244">Oh, you need something from me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3245">Work has a way of totally throwin' off your whole day
when things don't go right, huh?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3246">Hey hey. How's the farm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3247">I'm doin'...okay.
Like, not great, but not bad, either.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3248">Hey, how're your tools? You're not using 'em while
they're damaged, are you?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3249">Drop by the store again. Keep in mind that I'm still in
training, so I can't personally do much for you yet.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

You don't feel, like...vulnerable at night?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="3253">Wow. You're tough, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

  <Entry Index="3256">I'm starting to enjoy my training.
B-But it's not like I'm not takin' it seriously or anything.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I've got you checking in on me, after all.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

I can't stand it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3265">Come to think of it, how old IS Grandpa, anyway?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I can't believe he's still spry as a spring chicken. Weird.
What's his secret?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3266">Huh? What's up? You need something?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3267">Shouldn't you be getting home?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

Like fire.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

I need to concentrate, okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3278">Oh, &lt;nickname&gt;. Here for some tool repair?
You've gotta show 'em to Grandpa, not me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3279">I'm working right now, so let's talk later.
Oh, hey, don't get me wrong. I'm really happy
you came to see me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3280">Hey, &lt;nickname&gt;. How's the farm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3281">Work's rough--I know--but let's both do our best. I'll do
everything I can for your sake too, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3282">Welcome. How're you feeling, &lt;nickname&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3283">Marrying you is one of the best decisions I've ever made.
You make me wanna work harder than ever.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3284">Welcome. How're things going at the farm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3285">It must be nice to have a family.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3286">Grandpa just won't recognize me as a full-fledged
blacksmith.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

I'm doin' the best I can here.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="3300">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

This place isn't very well-known, but there's a lotta solid
literature here.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3314">If you find a good book, let me know. It might help me
discover what I'm lacking.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3315">"Books are love! Books are life!"
Heard someone say that once.
Can't say I disagree at this point.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3316">Marie's like a never-ending source of good book
recommendations.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3317">Oh, hey, &lt;nickname&gt;. I don't usually see you here.
What's up?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3318">I'm here as part of my training.
The hardest part is reflecting upon my weaknesses
so I can improve.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3319">Before, I felt like I was being forced to come up here, but
it's different with Marie.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

tension first.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

He says it's to help me develop a sharper sense of focus.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

you have the chance.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

something for sure. Though, I say that every year, and
I've yet to get lucky...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

know. There's usually a good lineup of alpacas and Angora
rabbits, too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3328">The Fluffy Festival may not be the most exciting festival
in the world, but I'm still interested to find out who
wins it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3329">Tomorrow, we get to celebrate this past year with the
whole town. I'm really looking forward to that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3330">You're an unfamiliar face around these parts.
...Ah, so you're the new caretaker of that farm. I see.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It must be difficult to manage a farm with only one set
of hands, but do your best out there.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Oh, I forgot to introduce myself.
The name's Saibara. Nice to meet you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3331">Ahem.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3332">Hahaha, I can't believe I'm still getting birthday presents
at my age. Thank you. I'll take it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3333">Mmm, I'm grateful. You've got real respect for your
elders, kid. Thanks for thinking of an old-timer like me. &lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Gray could learn a thing or two from you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3334">Well, thank you. I'll happily take it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3335">Ah, a gift. I'll take it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3336">Sorry, but I have no need for this.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3337">Just what are you trying to pull?!
Ugh. Kids these days need to mind their manners.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3338">Such a tiny creature, and yet it faces every day with
mighty vitality. It's a reminder to live mindfully.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3339">Urgh... Sorry, but I'm busy right now.
Go show that to someone else.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3340">What, are you unsatisfied with my craftsmanship?
All sales are final.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3341">Mmm... And what, exactly, am I supposed to do with this?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3342">Ho ho, now that's not something you see every day.
Is that perfume?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
What, exactly, is the point of wearing something like that,
anyway?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3343">You should be giving this to some nice young man,
not an old-timer like me.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You're an odd one.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3344">Oh, before I forget, I'll teach you how to make something
called a Winter Sun.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If you feel like making it, commit what I'm about to tell
you to memory.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The required ingredients are: Moonstone, Sandrose,
Emerald, Diamond...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...and although they're hard to come by, you'll also need
Pink Diamond, Alexandrite, and Mythic Ore.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You won't need any kitchen tools.
Just put all the ingredients together.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3345">I see. A Blue Feather, hm?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
No need to waste time showing me.
Go on and give it to the one you love.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3346">Ho ho, &lt;playername&gt;.
Is little &lt;childname&gt; well?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3347">I have a great-grandchild now.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Perhaps I'll continue clinging to these old bones until
I can see &lt;childname&gt; get married. Ho ho.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3348">How's married life treating you?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

Try not to work yourself too hard.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3363">You're a funny one.
What do you need with this old man, hm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3364">Oh ho. Hello, &lt;playername&gt;.
I came to buy ingredients for supper.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3365">When my spouse passed away, I had no idea how
to take care of myself. These days, I'm a little more
self-sufficient.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3366">&lt;playername&gt;. Are you done working?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I always take a hot bath after work.
It's part of my daily routine now.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
At my age, I don't think it's such a bad habit to have.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3367">Even Gray's expressed concern for my health. It's a bit
embarrassing to have him fuss over me, but I'm glad he
cares.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3368">Oh ho, it's &lt;playername&gt;.
Will you have a drink with me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3369">Gray has changed since he married you.
He regards both me and his training with a different
attitude now.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
He's almost like a completely different person...though he
still has some maturing to do.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3370">Have you ever tried any of the drinks here,
&lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If you haven't, you ought to.
At least once.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3371">Ever tried rice milk? I have, and let me tell you, it stands
on equal footing with the drinks here.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3372">Oh ho. Hello, &lt;playername&gt;.
It's such a nice night.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3373">I'm at that age now, you now. I have a duty to teach Gray
everything I know before I leave this world behind.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3374">Ugh, that grandson of mine...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Now that he's married, he refuses to climb the mountain
with me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3375">Hmph. You know what? I lived just fine by myself before
he came. In fact, it's refreshing to be left alone!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3376">Ahem. Are you climbing the mountain as well,
&lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
On Thursdays, I always close the store and hike up here.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3377">Make sure you relax from time to time.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3378">What's the matter?
Is all well on the farm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3379">Don't you think you should quit wasting time here and

  <Entry Index="3380">You're a hard worker yourself.
I can see how much you've grown.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

bets on--hrm. Actually, perhaps it'd be best to keep that

Whaddaya want me to do with it?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3396">Huh? I don't need any of that crap.
Here, take it back. C'mon.

  <Entry Index="3397">Gahaha! I see these little guys out on the mountain every
day, y'know.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="3399">If my little girl was still alive, she'd be at about that age

  <Entry Index="3400">That's the spittin' image of somethin' my late wife used

givin' me chocolate.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3403">Ever hearda Okonomiyaki? Now THAT'S the good stuff.
Simple, too. All ya gotta do is mix the ingredients
together.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If you want, I'll teach ya the recipe.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3404">So, yeah, lessee...
First, you start with some Wheat Flour, right?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Then, you add some Cabbage. Maybe a little Mochi
if you're feelin' fancy. And you'll need an Egg, too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3405">You whip all that stuff together, then Oil up your
Fryin' Pan and cook till golden-brown.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Whoops, almost forgot! You'll wanna chop that Cabbage
up with your Knife first. And there ya have it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

y'hear?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

&lt;linkedfarmname&gt; Farm has got some amazing
construction goin' on.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'd like to go see it sometime.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3408">Some years ago, an old coot by the name o' Chuu
used to live with me.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Loved to collect and study bugs and bees and stuff.
Somethin' 'bout Mineral Town's insects really fascinated
him.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Saw him take off chasing a butterfly one day, and poof.
Gone. He ain't come back yet. How far did he follow
that thing?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3409">Yo. Sorry, but I'm not on the clock right now.
Won't take no commissions. Them's the rules.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

here for?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3411">Oh. It's just you, &lt;playername&gt;.
Ah, sorry.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I didn't mean that to be rude or nothin'.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3412">Now, I LIKE livin' way out here by myself, but sometimes,
when it's real quiet, I'll see some weird stuff.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
What, ya gettin' scared? Then scoot on home 'fore it gets
too dark.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3413">You be careful when you climb that mountain alone,
ya hear me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3414">It ain't like there're bears or wolves, but it don't hurt to
be cautious.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3415">Yo. Looks like you're keepin' busy.
Good luck with everything.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3416">Yo. I'm lookin' for some good trees to turn into lumber.
Figured I'd forage for some stuff to eat while I'm at it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3417">A friendly tip: if you're thinkin' of chopping down some
trees, don't just go out there and start whackin' away.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Have some respect and take only what ya need.
The mountain is sharin' her bounty with us humans,
after all.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3418">Yo. I was just headed off to see the mayor. Been a while,
so I thought I'd say hey and catch up.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3419">Yo. I come on down into town on Saturdays. Y'know,

  <Entry Index="3420">Been up on the mountain for a while now. I'd go nuts
if I didn't come down and be social with folks sometimes.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3421">Yo, &lt;playername&gt;. How's work?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

You like this spot too?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3424">Lost my family here some years back.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Basil likes bringin' his family up this way for hikes. That's
fine and all, but I ask him not to when it's snowy out.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3425">You be careful, too, &lt;playername&gt;.
Ya hear me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3426">Hm... Ah. &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3427">You'd better head on back down 'fore too long.
It's gettin' dark.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3428">Yo. Things are comin' along nicely.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3429">Just kick back and relax.
I'll have it done in a jiff.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3430">Spendin' as much time out here alone as I do, sometimes
I'll see some really out-there stuff.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
When I get home, I always stop and think to myself,
"Did that really happen? Or was I just dreamin'?"&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3431">If you're gonna go up the mountain, make sure ya come
back down before sunset. It's dangerous up there in the
dark.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

me.&lt;wait&gt; </Entry>

Can't wait to finally eat some decent grub for once.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3437">Hm. Guess I could bring a few mushrooms from the
mountain for the Harvest Festival.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3438">Harvest Festival's tomorrow. It's a real fun time,
gatherin' 'round the giant pot with the whole town.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3439">You gonna be racin' in the upcomin' Derby? I'm goin'
either way, so I wouldn't mind cheerin' ya on.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3440">Tomorrow's Derby is gonna be a darn good time.
Y'know what's not a darn good time, though?
Tryin' to pick which horse to bet on...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3441">A few more days and it'll be the Fluffy Festival, right?
You enterin' any of your furry friends?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3442">Lookin' at animals is pretty calmin' to me, so I'm eager to
watch the Fluffy Festival.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3443">Tomorrow, you'll be able to eat all the soba noodles you

  <Entry Index="3463">Whoa, sooo pretty. Um, what is it?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3464">Hey, guess what? The other day, I talked with Mommy on
the phone!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
She sounded happy.
I wonder when she'll come back?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3465">I heard they sell a giant stuffed teddy bear
in Forgotten Valley.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Also, also, it MOVES sometimes! Doesn't that sound
SO cool? I wish I had one.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3466">Hello there, lady.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3467">Hello there, mister.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3468">Grandpa's real busy and his legs aren't so good,
so he can't play with me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3469">Whenever I mention Mommy to Grandpa, he gets all
quiet.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3470">When Grandpa looks sad or gets angry, it makes me
wanna cry too.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But then Grandpa always tells me that I'm a good girl.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3471">Awww, the weather's super icky today.
I can't go outside on days like this.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3472">I caught a cold before 'cuz I went out when it was
raining.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And then Grandpa told me I wasn't allowed to go out in
the rain ever again.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3473">I hope it's sunny tomorrow.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3474">Night night, lady.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="3479">Today's the day Grandpa goes to the Hot Spring.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3480">But I hate that place!
It's waaay too hot.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3481">Oh, lady! Hi there.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3482">Oh, mister! Hi there.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="3487">Oh, hi, lady. Play with me!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3488">Oh, hi, mister. Play with me!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3489">You've got work to do? Awww...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3490">Work, work, work.
Adults are always so busy working.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But then how come Carter has time to play with me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3491">I love the animals here.
You do too, huh?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3492">I love the animals here.
You do too, huh?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3493">Grandpa talks with the animals a lot.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I wonder if I'll be able to talk with them when I get
bigger too?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3494">Hey, do you know about my mommy?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
She's real nice, just like you.
Except she's gone right now.
But I'm sure she'll come to visit.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

I get kinda sleepy when I listen to him sometimes, though.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3497">I wanna pound the Mochi, too! I looove Mochi! It's so good!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3498">Do you like horses, lady? You do?! I do, too!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="3500">Tomorrow, we'll be able to see sooo many horses!
I can't wait!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3501">I think the Moo-Moo Festival will be here soon!
What kinds of cows d'you think are gonna be there?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3502">Grandpa always gets reeeal busy right before the
Moo-Moo Festival, so I wanna work hard and help
him, too!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3503">Are you gonna be in the Concert too?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3504">Are you gonna be in the Concert too?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3505">I love listenin' to music! What kinda music's gonna be at
tomorrow's Concert? Do you know?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3506">It's gonna be the Fluffy Festival soon! Staring at
a sheep's eyes can be kinda scary, but they're
super duper cute!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3507">Grandpa's gonna be super busy during the Fluffy Festival
tomorrow... So I probably will be, too!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3508">Oh ho, so you're &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
My name's Mugi. Nice to meet you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3509">What? A birthday present?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Haha... So that's why Mei picked some flowers and gave
them to me earlier.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3510">This is my favorite. Thank you.
I gratefully accept.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3511">What is all this about? You don't have to pay me any
special mind. I do appreciate it, though.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3512">Thanks. I'll take it off your hands.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3513">Erm, thanks...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But giving this to an old-timer like me doesn't do anyone
any good.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3514">I admit you've lost me with this one. What am I supposed
to do with it, exactly?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3515">Oh ho! Did you come to show me that? I hope Mei grows
up to be as kind as you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3516">Foxes are terrifying creatures.
What will you do if one ensnares you in some wily trap?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3517">Ho ho, how beautiful. Maybe I'll give it to Mei when she
grows up. Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3518">Ho ho! This would make a fine present for Mei when she
grows up. Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3519">Ho ho! What a pleasant fragrance.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3520">Oh? Is this for me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3521">Ah, that's right! Let me teach you how to make
Ice Cream.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Mei pestered me into learning how to make it.
Remember what I'm about to tell you, hm?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You'll need Milk, an Egg, and a Seasoning Set.
As for cookware, you'll need a Whisk and a Pot.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
We all scream for ice cream, as they say. Ho ho.
You should try making some yourself.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3522">Oh ho, a Blue Feather. About to propose to someone,
I take it? Good luck.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3523">Hello, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3524">Do you know a place called Forgotten Valley?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Apparently, there's a farmer there who really knows
their way around a stable.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3525">There's a tortoise in Forgotten Valley that used to be
owned by a comic artist long ago, apparently.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3526">On Mondays, I like to visit the mayor at his house.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3527">Today's when I take my usual trip to the Hot Spring.
I'm glad it's sunny out.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3528">I feel much better now. A soak in the Hot Spring really
soothes both body and soul.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3529">I WAS going to visit the Hot Spring today, but the
weather says otherwise. It's quite unfortunate.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3530">What are you doing around here?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3531">It's just me and my little granddaughter here.
Nothing of interest for you, I'm sure.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3532">Every morning, I check to see how the animals are doing.
Things can get out of hand quickly if you forget about
them.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3533">Dogs truly are man's best friend.
They get smarter the more you play fetch with them,
you know.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3534">How are things at your place? Did you get your cows and
chickens inside?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3535">Be careful not to catch a cold yourself.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3536">Oh? Did you come to visit?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3537">Come see us again sometime.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3538">Is your farm developing nicely? It will no doubt be an
undertaking to get it looking like it once did. Good luck.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3539">Something tells me you can do just about anything if you
put your mind to it, though.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3540">Being a mayor sounds very, very difficult.
Politics and administration are two things
I could never handle.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3541">Speaking of which, Thomas's father was a mayor, too.
I wonder if Harris will follow in his footsteps someday.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3542">I wonder how Saibara and Ellen are holding up?
Maybe we should all get together sometime.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3543">&lt;playername&gt;, life is short. You should make as many
friends as you can.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3544">Oh, is everything all right?
Are you considering a dip in the Hot Spring as well?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3545">Mei doesn't seem to like getting in hot water.
Literally, I mean. She always waits for me outside.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3546">Phew, nothing like a long soak to ease the aches and pains
of these old bones.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's such a luxury to have a Hot Spring right around the
corner from home!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3547">You know, if I wasn't so lucky to have a Hot Spring
at my disposal...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...I might have had to retire from farming by now.
I'm really grateful.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3548">Kids these days stay up way too late.
I have a hard time putting Mei to bed.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3549">I think I'm going to head to bed soon myself.
See you tomorrow.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3550">Are you taking good care of your animals?
They're the best judge of character around,
you know.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3551">&lt;playername&gt;. If you have some free time, could you
play with Mei?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3552">I talk to the animals every day. Developing trust with
your livestock is an essential part of being a farmer.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3553">I wonder how Ellen's doing? I'm sure she'd be pleased to
receive a visit from you, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3554">Old as I am, the thrill of betting at the Derby still hasn't
lost its luster. Speaking of, I've still got to place this
season's wager!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3555">The horses at this season's Derby are all quite splendid!
Do you have any particular favorites?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3556">Only the strongest chickens can win the Cluck-Cluck
Clash. If you ask me, it takes teamwork from both bird
and owner to take the prize.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3557">Now, the question is, which chicken will take home the
prize this year...?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3558">I've been so busy with preparations for the Moo-Moo
Festival, that I haven't even checked to see whose cows
are entering yet!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3559">Oof, these old bones are aching from all these festival
preparations... But I know it'll all be worth it tomorrow.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3560">Old as I am, the thrill of betting at the Derby still hasn't

Do you have any particular favorites?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3562">We celebrate several types of animals at the Fluffy

What brings you to me today?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3666">The energies that radiate from this mountain do much
to soothe my soul.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3667">The twittering of the birds...
The gentle babbling of the brook...
The whisper of the wind...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
When I visit the mountain in solitude, nature speaks,
and I am obliged to listen. Is that not wondrous?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3668">Sometimes, when I am alone in my tent, I will sense a
presence altogether alien to this plane.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

  <Entry Index="3671">Do you raise crops on your farm? Some farmers choose
to utilize fertilizer and chemicals to raise quality
vegetables.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

naturally, with little interference from human hands.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3672">The fertilizers I've seen used in this town are all-natural,
so I am not especially worried about their use.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

Come to think of it, I don't believe I've learned your child's
name yet.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
&lt;childname&gt;, is it? Lovely. Your family, blessed as it
is by Mother Nature, will no doubt foster a healthy child.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3693">I am excited to watch &lt;childname&gt; grow into
a person that reflects your values.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3694">I wonder what it feels like to build a new family
for oneself...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3695">My heart would be full if I could give all children the
chance to grow at their own pace in Mother Nature's
embrace.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3696">&lt;playername&gt;, your countenance has taken on a new
dimension since the birth of your child.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3697">I wonder, are humans meant to live together as family?
I can't help but think that's what Mother Nature intends.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3698">I cannot for the life of me understand Mr. Carter, the

beautiferous and soothing melody by way of Her ocean
waves.&lt;wait&gt; </Entry>
  <Entry Index="3705">Strolling along the beach, I often discover lovely
gemstones called sea glass embedded in the sand.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
They are bits of glass weathered by the waves for
decades, eventually becoming smooth, frosted pebbles.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I find them quite marvelous.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3706">Oh. Hello. Are you a resident here?

  <Entry Index="3721">Hm? My, you look awfully serious today.
Tell me what's going on.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Aha. Yes. I believe we have something we must discuss.
Let's go to your house for some privacy, shall we?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3722">Oh, a Preserved Flower. Ah, an interesting item indeed.
Why are you showing it to me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3723">Wait, is that...?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Perhaps we should go somewhere private to discuss this.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3724">I think it is much too early for us to be considering such
a big step.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3725">I...need a little more time before I can give serious
thought to that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3726">Oh, are these cookies for me?
Why, thank you! I admit I have something

Thank you ever so much! ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

greater heights.&lt;wait&gt; </Entry>
  <Entry Index="3800">Ah. &lt;playername&gt;. If you'll permit me to say
something rather straightforward...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You have an attractive face. It is an aesthetically
faithful recreation of your inner beauty.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3801">Quiet, please. I wish to observe your face
in greater detail.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The tingle of inspiration tickles at the periphery
of my mind.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3802">When you view an object with your eyes, at first it is
simply a collection of shapes and lines.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
As you dig beneath that facade and discover its true
form within, your path to expressing that form becomes
clear.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3803">"An image is worth a thousand words." To fully
comprehend that phrase, you must still your tongue
and use your eyes.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
See the work. FEEL it.
Feel it with your body and your soul.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3804">Almost...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3805">Even in marriage, I think we both should still pursue our
chosen endeavors freely, helping each other as needed.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3806">I hear you got married.
Are things going well?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3807">I am as I have always been.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3808">Ah. &lt;playername&gt;. How is married life?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3809">I may need to go in search of new inspiration soon.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3810">I hear you had a child.
Being a parent must be laborious indeed.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3811">Building and caring for a family are prospects far
beyond my meager artistic talents.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3812">You seem well. I guess it is true what people say about
parenthood being a transformative force.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3813">Children are geniuses. They see things for what they are,
and can express themselves with enviable clarity.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3814">Hello.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3815">What is it?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3816">What business have you with me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3817">I will occasionally stroll through this locale, searching for
inspiration and materials alike.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3818">The imagination is a critical tool for artists.
I nurture and grow mine through interaction
both social and natural.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3819">Speaking with you is refreshing, &lt;playername&gt;.
You ignite my imagination.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3820">Hm? And you are?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
&lt;playername&gt;? I see.
I am Brandon. The pleasure's mine.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3821">Thank you. This seems useful.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3822">Thank you, &lt;playername&gt;. I'm surprised you are
aware of my preferences.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3823">For me? Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3824">Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3825">...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3826">What is this? I have no need of it.
Take it away, would you?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3827">Ah. Thank you. Come to think of it, today is my birthday,
isn't it? I'd utterly forgotten.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3828">Yes. Quite cute.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3829">That does not interest me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3830">I appreciate all things beautiful on principle...
Do you think this suits me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3831">I have little interest in such things, but if you are giving it
to me, I will accept it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3832">Mm. A nice scent.
You have surprisingly refined taste.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3833">What is it, &lt;playername&gt;? A Preserved Flower?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...No. I can guess. We cannot speak privately here.
Let us abscond to your house.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3834">It has come to my attention that this is the object
presented during the act of confessing one's romantic
interest.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Ah. If you are presenting it to me, I am sorry.
I am uninterested in such things.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3835">Ah...! That is...!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Let us go somewhere we can discuss this in private.
Your house seems wise.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3836">I think it is still too soon for us. There is no hurry.
Let's take our time.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3837">It would please me to visit Forgotten Valley sometime.
Have you heard of it?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3838">Thank you. I enjoy sweet foods.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3839">Thank you. I enjoy sweet foods.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Hm? A return present for last White Day? Ah. I must say,
though, there was no particularly deep meaning in that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3840">Thank you. I enjoy sweet foods.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Hm? A return present for last White Day? Ah.
I'd entirely forgotten about this ritual.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3841">Valentine's Day? Ah. No wonder.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
No, no. If you are certain you wish to give this to me,
I will gladly accept. Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3842">Valentine's Day? Ah. No wonder.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
So it is still acceptable to give and receive these even
after entering into a relationship. I like that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3843">Sources suggest that the night sky will be particularly
lovely tomorrow. Would you care to join me in stargazing?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3844">Ah. Excellent. Come no later than 6:00 PM, then.
I will be waiting.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3845">Ah. A pity.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3846">Mm. Good morning.
My head is still in something of a fog.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3847">Living on a farm means rising far earlier than I am
accustomed to. I will need time to acclimate.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3848">It is odd. Simply being here somehow compels me to take
the day at a more relaxed pace.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3849">Farm work keeps one quite busy, I see.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3850">I suggest making restful sleep a priority. You exert
yourself quite a bit in the course of your daily chores.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3851">Darkness brings with it its own inspirations. This town is
quiet enough to allow them the space to grow.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3852">Good morning, &lt;nickname&gt;. The morning hours on a
farm are quite pleasant, I find.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3853">Recently, I've found my creative spirit fully engaged,
even in the early morning hours.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3854">If you are tired, take a break.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3855">There are so many fascinating things to observe here
that I don't foresee myself growing bored any time soon.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3856">Why not retire for the night?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3857">Pay me no heed.
If you wish to retire, please go ahead.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3858">Good morning, &lt;nickname&gt;. I have been here long
enough that I feel in tune with the earth's natural
rhythms.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3859">It occurs to me that all the time I have spent with you
has marked a shift in my artistic style,
&lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3860">It's odd, really. I could not tell you how, but marriage has
changed my worldview somehow.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3861">It's odd, really. I could not tell you how, but marriage has
changed my worldview somehow.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3862">&lt;nickname&gt;, I am beginning to feel your presence
in my creative process. I think this piece may be one
of my best.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3863">Is the farm doing well? I do not recommend overexerting
yourself.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3864">&lt;nickname&gt;, I think your presence has become an
integral part of my creation process. You are my muse.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3865">Ah. Hello, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3866">Do not disturb me, please.
I am attempting to brainstorm.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3867">Hello, &lt;nickname&gt;.
Is something the matter?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3868">If you have no business with me, please do not disturb my
thought process.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3869">Where are you going?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3870">This is no idle stroll. When I take my walks, I find varied
inspiration in what I observe.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3871">The seeds of creation bud in nature and the natural
order of things. I like to observe what my eye catches
keenly.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3872">There are a vast multitude of things in this town that
spur my imagination.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3873">It seems everyone likes you, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3874">You know, I think my works have become brighter and
more optimistic since I married you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3875">You know, I think my works have become brighter and
more optimistic since I married you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3876">Right now, inside your body, resides a new, budding life.
What a strange and wondrous thing to ponder.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3877">Creating new life... Nature is as powerful as it is
magnificent.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3878">I can see your belly is starting to protrude somewhat.
Are you all right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3879">Your body and health are important.
Take care of them both.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3880">Are you feeling all right? You seem to have become
somewhat sedentary. Perhaps a little exercise would do
you good.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3881">I think I'd like to create something based on the image of
you as you are now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3882">I believe our child will soon be born. Are you prepared?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3883">At a time like this, there is little I can do.
It is all in your hands.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3884">I can still hardly believe that I have a child now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3885">Family... It still does not feel real.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3886">&lt;childname&gt; is growing.
From my perspective, at least.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3887">Watching &lt;childname&gt; is so amusing.
I don't think I'll ever get bored.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3888">Children are geniuses. Their imagination paints the world
with colors I could only dream of.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3889">I wonder what &lt;childname&gt; is thinking.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
How fascinating it would be to take a peek within the
mind of a child.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3890">&lt;childname&gt; has begun acting more like a real child
and less like a noisy flesh-bean.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3891">Do you think &lt;childname&gt; resembles me in
appearance?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
No. Our child's facial features are definitely much more
reminiscent of yours, &lt;nickname&gt;.
Don't you agree?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3892">It's odd. I can't shake the feeling that &lt;childname&gt;
is starting to resemble me.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Wait...no. I think the resemblance stems from you more
than me. Don't you agree?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3893">It is startling how quickly children grow.
We, too, are growing older in turn...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3894">I wonder what sort of art &lt;childname&gt;
will create?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Whatever it is, I'm sure it will be magnificent.
I would expect no less of our child.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3895">Does your stomach trouble you?
Do not stress yourself overmuch.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3896">I will soon be a father.
...I hope I don't mess it up too badly.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3897">Is &lt;childname&gt; well?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3898">I'd like to take &lt;childname&gt; for a stroll sometime.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3899">Aah, thank you! I am always happy to receive gifts
like these.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3900">Aah, thank you, &lt;nickname&gt;!
I knew I could trust my wife to remember my
preferences.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3901">Aah, thank you, &lt;nickname&gt;!
I knew I could trust my husband to remember my
preferences.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3902">A thoughtful present. Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3903">Thank you, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3904">...You DO know my preferences, right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3905">Why are you giving this to me? You ought to know what
gives me joy and what gives me pause.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3906">Ah, thank...you?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Oh. Today is my birthday, isn't it?
At least one of us remembered. Haha.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3907">You aren't suggesting we keep it, are you?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3908">I enjoy beauty in all forms simply on principle, but I think
this may suit you better than me, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3909">I am not generally interested in these things, but if you
are giving it to me, I will accept it.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Do you not feel a little odd about gifting such things to
your husband, though?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3910">I am not generally interested in these things, but if you
are giving it to me, I will accept it.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Do you not feel a little odd about gifting such things to
your husband, though?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3911">A-Ah! Is that...?!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
We must speak in private.
Let us abscond to your house.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3912">A-Ah! Is that...?!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I see. I am grateful you feel that way, but I...I do not.
Not yet, at least. I'm sorry.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3913">Someday, I would like to visit Forgotten Valley.
We could make a trip of it, you and I.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3914">Ah, sweets? Thank you. You know me all too well.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
We are married now. You really needn't worry about
that, you know.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3915">Thank you. I enjoy sweet foods.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Hm? A return present for last White Day? We are
married now. You really needn't worry about that,
you know.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3916">For Valentine's Day?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Ah. So it is tradition to continue giving such things even
after marriage? I've learned something today. Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3917">For Valentine's Day?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Ah. So it is tradition to continue giving such things even
after marriage? I've learned something today. Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3918">I wonder what sort of art &lt;childname&gt; will
create?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Whatever it is, I'm sure it will be magnificent.
I would expect no less of our child.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3919">Ah, the Fireworks Festival is tomorrow, is it not?
It should prove to be a great source of inspiration
for my work.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3920">Tomorrow evening will be a full moon. Why, I might just
transform! ...I was kidding. You needn't look so concerned.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3921">&lt;nickname&gt;, thank you!
I knew I married you for good reason. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3922">Good morning, &lt;nickname&gt;. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3923">It feels...odd. But that odd feeling is a sign
that Mother Nature has taken Her course.
I now hold new life within me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3924">I am fine. This is all a perfectly natural process.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3925">I have been so hungry lately. SO hungry. I have to eat
more, both for myself and for the baby I'm carrying.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3926">Just so that you are aware, I am not fat. I'm pregnant.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3927">My belly keeps getting bigger and bigger. I wonder what
our child will be like.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3928">Will it be a boy? A girl? Who will they resemble?
I can hardly wait to find out. Don't you agree,
&lt;nickname&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3929">Oof... Mmh... I think the baby's arrival is probably
imminent, given these...kicks...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3930">&lt;nickname&gt;! You do your best too!
We will both excel--together!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3931">Babies are splendiferously cute, aren't they?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3932">&lt;childname&gt; is the cutest baby in the whole
world--though I suppose that's obvious,
being OUR baby and all.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3933">Children grow so quickly.
It's as if they get bigger by the hour.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3934">My heart would be full if I could give our child a leisurely
upbringing surrounded by Mother Nature's embrace.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3935">You know, I think &lt;childname&gt; may be starting
to speak.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3936">I cannot say how, but I think I understand what
&lt;childname&gt; is saying.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3937">&lt;childname&gt; is getting big enough to walk. Before
too long, we will be able to go for family strolls together.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3938">You, me, and &lt;childname&gt;. All three of us can go for
a walk up the mountain and discover Mother Nature's
beauty.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3939">&lt;childname&gt; is growing up to be a healthy and
happy child. We are truly blessed.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3940">I left my home and abandoned my old family, but now I'm
starting to see the merits of a family who loves you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Perhaps I will go back there one day to visit Mother and
Father.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3941">Getting exercise is good for my health and the baby both.
The same goes for basking in the energy of Mother
Nature.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3942">Did you know babies can hear when they are in the
womb? Natural sounds can be especially nurturing
and pacifying.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3943">Oh, hello, &lt;nickname&gt;.
How is &lt;childname&gt; doing?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3944">Every now and again, I need to get out and immerse
myself in Mother Nature's energies. And breathe in
Her air.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I hope to bring &lt;childname&gt; along with me
sometime soon.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3945">I wonder what sort of person &lt;childname&gt; will
grow up to be.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3946">I want to give &lt;childname&gt; a leisurely upbringing
spent learning and growing in the embrace of
Mother Nature.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3947">I have always seen you as someone who understands me
for who I am, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Of course, I like to believe that I understand you for who
you are, too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3948">Whether man or woman, young or old, you or me, we all
live by the grace of Mother Nature's bounteous gifts.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The two of us living together as one is surely what She
wished of us.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3949">Fireworks are such whimsical things: burning as bright as
a star only to disappear in a flash...! I look forward to
tomorrow night's festivities.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3950">Mother Nature is kind to share Her lunar powers with
us, after Her long journey to the summit. We mustn't
take these cosmic gifts for granted.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3951">Oh, dear. I'm afraid I really don't care for this at all,
sweetheart.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Don't worry. I'm sure you just didn't know. It's all right.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3952">Gah! I really can't stand that...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
What, is this news to you? Ah, that's okay then.
Can't blame you for not knowing.&lt;wait&gt; </Entry>
  <Entry Index="3953">Eeew! I really don't like that!
...What, you didn't know? Oh. Well, then I forgive you.
Just don't do it again!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3954">Erm! I'm sorry, but, er...
I really do not like that...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
No, no. If no one told you, you wouldn't know. It's all right.
Everyone makes mistakes.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3955">Yuck! I don't like those! Not one bit! Oh, you didn't know? I
guess that's okay. You didn't know better.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3956">Urk...! You want me to take that?
Can't say it does anything for me...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Ah well. It's not as if you knew I would react that way.
It's fine.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3957">Oh, uh, sorry. I'm really not into that... Ah, you didn't
know? Gotcha. Not much for it, then. No worries.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3958">O-Oh, uh... Sorry. I don't like this kinda stuff.
What, you didn't know? Ah. That's okay, then.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3959">Oh dear. That? I don't like that at all. Still, if you didn't
know, you didn't know. Just please don't do it again.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3960">Ah, I'm afraid I'm rather unfond of those. Hm?
You're surprised to find out there's something
I dislike?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Hahaha. I'm human just like everyone else, you know.
We all have preferences.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3961">Oh, this is... Erm... Well, to be blunt, I'm not fond of this
at all.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Oh, you didn't know? Goodness, did I not tell you?
Well, no wonder, then. It's all right. You didn't know
better.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3962">Goodness, that's worse than a papercut. But I never told
you I didn't like those, did I? You had no way of knowing.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3963">Oof! I, ah, am rather terribly unfond of these...
Oh, you didn't know? Aaah. That's all right, then.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I am the mayor, yes, but I am also a person, too.
I have my likes and dislikes, like anyone else.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3964">...Erm, I'm afraid this isn't really something
I'm comfortable with. I didn't tell you, so you couldn't
have known.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Still, as someone who tries to be a role model for others,
I'm embarrassed to admit there are things I dislike.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3965">My, my... I don't like these, dear.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Aah, you didn't know? There's no point in making you feel
bad about it, then. You just didn't know better.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3966">Goodness, did Yu put you up to this?
...Oh, wait. You wouldn't know I dislike these, would you?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's fine. I can't blame you for not knowing better.
Assuming you're being honest with me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3967">Gah! You're copying me?!
But I hate these things!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Though I guess if you just didn't know... Ugh, now I'm
starting to get how everyone feels when I mess with 'em.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3968">Oh, uh, yay...? Thank youuuaaARGH.
Nope. I can't do it. I'm sorry, but I can't stand these.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Still, you couldn't have known better. 
I never said anything about it to you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3969">Ah, sorry. I'm pretty bothered by those. Oh, you didn't
know? Well, I guess it's all right, then.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But let this be a lesson, okay?
Please don't do this again.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3970">I like this about as much as I like an empty bottle. Which
is to say...I don't. But it's okay. We all make mistakes.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3971">...I'm afraid I don't like these at all.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
No, no. You wouldn't have known unless I told you.
It's all right. I know you didn't mean anything by it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3972">Heavens... Folks say I have saintly patience, but even
I have a few things that rub me the wrong way.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Well, all right. A lot of things.
But I forgive you, my child. You simply did not know
better this time.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3973">Um, I don't like these. I tend to keep that kind of stuff
to myself, so you wouldn't have known. It's okay.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3974">Urf! Wow, uh... Sorry, but I don't like this much at all.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Still, you wouldn't have known that, would you? It's okay,
it's okay. I know you didn't mean anything by it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3975">The heck?! Um, sorry, but that's almost worse than
a dirty floor to me...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Oh well! It's not like you could've known, huh? Ha ha ha.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3976">I, uh, hate this almost as much as I hate winter. But you
couldn'ta known, so I guess it's not really your fault.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3977">Ah, this crap? Sorry. I ain't too fond of it. Still, I doubt
you knew, so I guess I'll give ya a mulligan.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3978">...I dislike those to the extreme. I rarely mention that to
others, though, so I guess you would not have known.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3979">I find this astonishingly awful. Though... You wouldn't have
known, as I did not tell you. I guess it's okay.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3980">Oh, uh...yeah. Sorry. I don't like these one bit. Ah well.
You couldn'ta known, right? Don't worry 'bout it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3981">Those? No. Worse than an empty wallet, yes? But you did
not know, so you cannot help it. All is forgiven.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3982">My, my! How unappetizing. But you did not know my
tastes skewed away from this. No reason to fret over it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3983">Oh, hi, &lt;playername&gt;. ...Oh, goodness, nooo. I don't like
these at all, silly.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's the first time you've made this mistake, so you
wouldn't know. Don't worry about it, don't worry
about it!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3984">Ick. I no like these at all... Oh well. First time, mistake.
Is okay.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3985">Erm, I'm afraid I must admit I do not care for those in
the slightest. But you did not know better.
Understandable.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3986">Ah, you wanna give me that? Yikes.
Can't say I feel much obliged.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Ah well. Nobody knows what they ain't been told yet.
A mistake's a mistake, and that's okay.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3987">Um, I'm sorry.
I don't like these at all.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But no one knows the first time. It's okay.
You just didn't know better.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3988">Um, I'm sorry.
I don't like these at all.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

  <Entry Index="3994">Hm? Dear, you've already been kind enough to give me
a present today. I couldn't ask for another one already.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3995">Thanks, but you already gave me a present today.
I'd feel guilty taking another one from you so soon.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3996">Thanks, but that's okay! You already gave me a present
today, silly.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3997">Oh, no, no. I couldn't. You were already kind enough to give
me a present earlier today.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3998">Huh? You already gave me a present today.
I like presents, but I don't want to be greedy.
Being greedy is selfish.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3999">Hold your horses, there. You already gave me a gift today.
One is more than enough for an old man like me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4000">Nah, that's okay. You already got me something today,
so I'm good.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4001">What, another present? Naaah. Thanks for the thought,
but you don't have to do that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4002">Oh my, another present? I couldn't. You were already kind
enough to give me one earlier.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4003">My, my! You already gave me a gift today, though,
so I think I will accept just the thought this time.
Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4004">Goodness, another one? You already gave me a gift today.
I couldn't ask you for another one so soon.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4005">Goodness, but you already gave me a present today.
One is more than enough for me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4006">Hrm? But you already gave me a gift today. I couldn't
possibly bother you for another one so soon.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4007">Hm? You're a model citizen, trying to give me a second
present today. I will gladly accept the thought, however.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4008">Oh dear, I couldn't. Not when you've already given
me a present today. But thank you for the thought,
sweetheart.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4009">Hm? But you already gave me a present today.
I hardly deserve another one.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4010">Ooh, wow! You're gonna give me another present today?
Man, you sure are super generous! Heck yeah!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Oh, but I can totally see my sister thinkin' I tricked you
into it. Um...maybe gimme it later, then?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4011">Oh, no, I couldn't. Not when you already gave me
something today. Really. Just the thought is more than
enough for me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4012">My! &lt;playername&gt;, didn't you already give me
a present earlier today? Two is too much.
Just the thought is enough.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4013">Huh? But didn't you already give me something today?
Just one is plenty for me, thanks. No need to suck up.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4014">Hm? Ah, thank you, truly, but you already gave a present
to me today. It would be unbecoming to ask for more.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4015">Oh my Goddess! For me? Thank you for the generous
thought, but you already gave a gift to me today.
One is plenty.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4016">You already gave me something today.
I couldn't ask for more.
I'm not sure I earned it anyway.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4017">What, another present? Thanks for the thought,
but I couldn't possibly.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4018">Huh? You already gave me something today.
One is enough for me. But thanks!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4019">Huh? Wait, I thought you already gave me somethin'
today. That's plenty, trust. I couldn't ask for more.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4020">You already got me somethin' today. Takin' another
would be just plain greedy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4021">You already gave me a gift today.
I wouldn't want to be boorish.
One is plenty.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4022">Hm? You have already given me a gift today. The thought
is more than enough. Mother Nature bless you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4023">Whoa, didn't you already give me somethin' today?
I'd feel too guilty if I took somethin' ELSE from ya.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4024">You want to give me more presents? Thank you,
but one is good. Two is too many.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4025">My, my. A tantalizing thought, but I have already received
a gift from you today.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4026">Goodness, but you already gave me an offering today.
Feeling overly generous today, are we?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4027">You gave me gift already. One is good.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4028">My, my! I couldn't possibly ask for a second gift in such a
short period. But your thoughtfulness is appreciated.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4029">Aw, shucks! A second present? But you already got me
one today. That's more than enough for me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4030">Is that for me? But you already got me a present today
I don't want to be greedy and ask for more.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4031">Is that for me? But you already got me a present today.
I don't want to be greedy and ask for more.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

I don't want to be greedy and ask for more.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4037">What's the matter, &lt;playername&gt;? What are you
doing with that Preserved Flower?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4038">Oh, don't tell me you're... M-Maybe we should go
somewhere else.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4039">You have a Preserved Flower? I wish someone would give
one to me one day.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4040">What's up? Why're you holding a Preserved Flower and
looking all serious?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4041">Hold up, you don't mean...?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4042">Uh, let's go somewhere else. It's a little too...public here.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4043">Wha?!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4044">Hold up, that's not for me, is it? You gotta hold onto that
until the time comes to use it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4045">What is it? Do you need something from me?
Wait, is that a Preserved Flower?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4046">It seems you have something serious to discuss.
Let's go somewhere else.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4047">What's the matter? You look so serious.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4048">Wait, that's...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4049">I understand. Perhaps we should go somewhere else.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4050">That's...a Preserved Flower?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4051">No no, you clearly aren't serious. Hmmm, might I suggest
that you refrain from making such jokes?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4052">Hey, when you were little, &lt;nickname&gt;, did you look
a lot like &lt;childname&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I only ask because you two look so similar! Or...maybe
when you're both together, you look even more alike!
...Am I making sense?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4053">Things are so much brighter with &lt;childname&gt;
around! Why, I'd go so far as to say I feel an extra spring
in my step.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4054">Now that &lt;childname&gt; is here, I suppose that
makes me a grandma. It's such a strange feeling.
Huh? You're surprised I feel that way?
Regardless of ancestry, I think of you and
&lt;childname&gt; as family. Don't you forget that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4055">I'm really glad we have &lt;childname&gt;. I feel like it's
helped me realize my purpose in life.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Yeah... I feel like I was born to meet you and
&lt;childname&gt;, &lt;nickname&gt;.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4056">So, what kind of person d'you think &lt;childname&gt;
will grow up to be? It's kinda fun to imagine.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4057">I see &lt;childname&gt; is as energetic as always.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4058">&lt;childname&gt; is ours, after all! As vigorous and
healthy as ever.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4059">Thank you so much, &lt;nickname&gt;. Words cannot
describe how grateful I am to have you and
&lt;childname&gt; in my life.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4060">How did &lt;childname&gt; get to be such a mischievous
little thing, anyway? Who did they get that from?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4061">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;. How is my precious little
grandchild doing? Oh, dear, now I just want to see
them again...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4062">Dad keeps saying &lt;childname&gt; looks just like us.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I hadn't noticed it myself, but...it is pretty nice to hear.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4063">I always thought it would be nice to have a little boy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4064">I always thought it would be nice to have a little girl.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4065">&lt;childname&gt; is so precious, yes? They're
mysteriously beginning to resemble you, by the way,
&lt;nickname&gt;. &lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4066">Hm? Did *I*? Well, that is a secret. Even to my spouse,
I will not say.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4067">Hm? What's up? Did you have something you wanted to
talk to me about?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4068">Well, either way, you're free to stay a while.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4069">Whoa, really? Haha, I'm so glad to have you as my wife,
&lt;nickname&gt;. ♪&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4070">Hm? Who might you be giving that to?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4071">Is that a Blue Feather you've got there? It is a lovely
trinket, but I am not particularly inspired by it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4072">Huh? Th-Thank you... But, um, you DO know that today's
Valentine's Day, right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4073">Thanks for always thinking of me on days like these,
&lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4074">Thanks... You're always so thoughtful to give me these
sorts of gifts no matter what season it is.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4075">Thanks... Uh, it's Valentine's Day, though. I-Is it still okay
for me to take this?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4076">Huh? O-Oh, it's Valentine's Day, isn't it? Haha, thanks...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4077">Thank you, &lt;nickname&gt;. I'm glad I can still get
presents like these from you even after marriage.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4078">Huh? Today's... Oh, yeah. Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4079">Thanks. Uh, you might've gotten the season wrong,
but it's the thought that counts, I guess.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4080">Huh? Chocolate? D'you have your festivals mixed up
or something?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Well, you went out of your way to give it to me, so...
I'll take it. Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4081">Hm? For me, you say?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Thank you kindly. That is very thoughtful of you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4082">Hm? Are you aware of which festival it is today?
Well, I suppose it doesn't matter in the long run...
Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4083">Hm? White Day cookies for me?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You are very kind to think of me today! Xie xie.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4084">Why, thank you! I see the occasion matters little to you.
You simply wish to spread joy, yes? I am happy to accept.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4085">Oh, yeah! It's White Day, huh?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's reassuring to know you're thinking of me, no matter
what season it is. Thank you!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4086">Haha, you're an awesome wife, you know that?
I'd be happy to accept.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4087">Huh? But it's Valentine's Day... Are you sure?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
That's so thoughtful of you! I love a good snack!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4088">Huh? But usually on White Day, the boys...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Eh, whatever. There's no way I'd turn down a gift from
my cute wife! Thank you!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4089">A Valentine's present for me? Gosh, thanks!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm supposed to be the one giving those to you, though...
My bad!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4090">Wooow, thank you! I'd be happy to take it!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Oh, but... I don't really have anything for you in return.
I'm sorry!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4091">Huh? A Valentine's Day gift?! Thank you!
Hee hee, being married is really nice.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I should've been the one to make you chocolates, though!
I'm sorry...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4092">Huh? But it's Valentine's Day, silly! Still, I'm sure you
went to a lot of trouble to do this...so I'll take it!
Thank you!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4093">H-Huh? For me...? I'm delighted. Thank you kindly for
thinking of me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4094">That looks delectable. Thank you so much...hm?
Today's White Day? Well, that's quite all right.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4095">Huh? You'd like to give that to me? That's quite generous
of you. Thank you very much.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4096">O-Oh, but it's Valentine's Day... Is it really all right for me
to take this? You're sure? ...Thank you so much.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4097">Well, aren't you the sweetest wife! I didn't think you'd
make me cookies, &lt;nickname&gt;. You've brightened
my day... Thank you. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4098">Oh, my! A Valentine's Day gift, for me...? I should have
made one for you first, though... I'm sorry.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4099">Ah, yes! I nearly forgot about Valentine's Day.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Thank you... Shouldn't I be the one giving gifts to you,
though? I appreciate it either way. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4100">The town's celebrating their Valentine's Day festivities,
aren't they?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...And you'd like to give your chocolates to me?
That's very sweet of you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4101">Is this...supposed to be a Valentine's Day present?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I thought I was supposed to give chocolates to you...
Regardless, I'm very grateful. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4102">Ah, it's Valentine's Day, isn't it?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...Well, if I'm the one you'd like to give chocolates to,
I won't refuse them. Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4103">Huh? Chocolates? Well, gosh, thanks! I love being married
to you, y'know.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Aren't I supposed to be the one giving the chocolates out,
though? Sorry about that...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4104">Ooh! This is for me?! Really?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Thank you! You're like a wife for all seasons!
It's super cute!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4105">Hm? But...today is Valentine's Day. Are you sure you
aren't mistaken? ...Really?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I accept. Thank you for thinking of me today.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4106">Huh, wait, this is for me? Ha ha, thanks! We ARE
together and all, and you know I can't say no to you...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4107">D'aww, shucks. Getting chocolate from a girl is kind of
embarrassing...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I-I'm not saying it's a bad thing! You're MY girl, after all!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4108">Good day, &lt;nickname&gt;. Here to shop? &lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You're shopping for two now, yes? It is quite marvelous to
think about!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4109">What's this, you say? I am looking more like a father by
the day? I am most happy to hear that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4110">Welcome, dear &lt;playername&gt;. Is everything all right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4111">I thought perhaps something had happened to
&lt;childname&gt;. I cannot wait to see their smiling
face.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I wonder what &lt;childname&gt; is doing now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4112">Welcome, &lt;nickname&gt;! How's &lt;childname&gt;
doing back home?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

  <Entry Index="4114">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;? Um, can you tell me you love me
again?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Hee hee, you don't have to if you're embarrassed. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4115">People are always telling me I act too childish...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But you don't think that, right, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4116">O-Oh, thanks... Boys are supposed to give out presents
today, but...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm just glad I could get a present from you,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

Hopefully she's not causing too much trouble for you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4121">I'm really glad she's with you, &lt;playername&gt;.
I can go visit you both any time!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If she were with that Kai, why, I don't think I would have
ever wanted to see her again!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4122">I'm starting to enjoy my training.
B-But it's not like I'm not takin' it seriously or anything.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

  <Entry Index="4128">Ooh, that's a Preserved Flower if I've ever seen one! So?
Who's on the receivin' end of that, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4129">It's still so surreal that we'll be getting married soon! ♪
Oh, and we'll get to both wear cute wedding dresses
together... Ugh, our wedding day needs to hurry UP!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

sometime!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4139">J-Just a moment... This is quite a lot to take in...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

Mind if I give it to--haha, don't look at me like that!
I'm just kiddin' with ya! Thanks!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4143">It is vital that the two of us continue to pursue our own
endeavors even after marriage...while aiding each other
in times of need along the way, of course.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4144">&lt;nickname&gt;, tomorrow is Starlight Night, isn't it?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
How would you like to watch the stars together?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4145">Oh, thanks, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Maybe I should send one to my mom back home, too...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4146">I am truly humbled that you would remember my
birthday. My gratitude.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
To be frank, it completely slipped my mind that today
was the day...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4147">Ah, many thanks! I should have expected nothing
less from you. You've done well to ascertain my
personal preferences.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4148">You have my thanks, &lt;playername&gt;! I quite like this.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4149">While I do have an eye for beautiful art, I have to wonder
if this sort of thing suits me...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Well, if you insist, &lt;playername&gt;, I accept.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4150">Erm... Th-Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4151">I have no interest in this, to be perfectly honest. But if it
is meant as a gift, then I've no choice but to take it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4152">Ah! Many thanks, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4153">What in the world IS this? I assure you, I have absolutely
no need for it.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But if I must take it, then...fine.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4154">I couldn't find work, so I've decided to leave,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Having to part with you and this town hurts, but...
I wanted to thank you. For everything.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

treating you?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4157">We must always make health our number one priority.
If you're ever feeling ill, please notify me at any time.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4158">Yu was just delighted, too. He kept telling me how excited
he was to have another older sister!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4159">Is this for me? Why, thank you! ∀ I'd be happy to take it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4160">What a heavenly smell! You have excellent taste,

Why, thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4165">&lt;playername&gt;, you do know that tomorrow is
Starlight Night, yes?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If you'd like, you're welcome to join me in watching
the stars.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4166">Oh? I see. I will simply enjoy the soothing energies of the
night sky on my own, then.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4167">During my stay at the Inn, Dudley has been nothing but

  <Entry Index="4169">Mom and Popuri don't have so much as a single bad thing
to say about Kai...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But I'm not surprised, seeing how women seem to fawn
all over him. That's another thing I don't like about him.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You, on the other hand? You're nothing like that,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4170">Ever since &lt;childname&gt; came into our lives,
Duke and I haven't been fighting as much.
It's like his prickly exterior has all but melted away.
I suppose you aren't at that point in your relationship
yet.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4171">Huh? Grandpa? Y'know, you're right.
We should invite him too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4172">It must be so fun to have someone to come home to.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="4174">Hi, &lt;playername&gt;! How's your better half?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4175">Isn't it nice having someone there to provide support?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
When you're by yourself, you end up having to do so much
on your own.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4176">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;. How are things at home?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4177">Tell your partner that I'll be dropping by sometime soon.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4178">Oh, how lovely! They have these flowers for sale now?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4179">They've got those flowers for sale now? ...Not that I have
any use for 'em.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4180">Wow, it's that flower we made! I'm super proud of how it
came out!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4181">It really is a beautiful flower...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4182">Oh, it's the flower that we made! It's so pretty, I'd never
ever get tired of looking at it!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4183">Oh, it's the flower from our experiment! It came out
great, if I do say so myself!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4184">It's our pretty flower! Too bad it doesn't look like it
would make for a good cooking ingredient.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4185">It's so pretty! I'm glad our experiment was a success.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4186">It is very pretty, but it doesn't look like it's very filling...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4187">My, what a lovely flower.
However, I have no need for it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4188">That flower has been popular of late. I hope your feelings
are conveyed.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4189">Seeing that you bought one, does that mean you plan to
confess your feelings to someone?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4190">If it isn't a Preserved Flower. They've been a lovely
addition to our store.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="4192">Well, ain't that a dandy-looking flower! What's that?

Well, good luck to you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4198">Oh? Well, if it isn't a Preserved Flower.
That's used to confess one's feelings, right?
How wonderful! Receiving such a lovely token of
affection along with words of love would be a dream

flower to someone special? I'm rooting for you!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4199">Oh, well now, look at this lovely specimen. It looks like

confess feelings? My, my. Good luck!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4200">A Preserved Flower? Are you planning to give that to
someone? That's great. If only I'd been able to convey my

  <Entry Index="4217">Oh, a Preserved Flower! How do they make these?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

fear of triggering someone's allergies.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4219">That's a Preserved Flower, yeah? Hmm, maybe we could
use one to decorate the Inn.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
