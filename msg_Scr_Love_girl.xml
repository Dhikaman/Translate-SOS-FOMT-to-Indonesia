  <Entry Index="8">Yep. We've got a lot of eggs again today. That's a good
sign that our chickens are all happy and healthy.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I soft-boiled a few of them to munch on while I was
working. Want one, Mom?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="9">My, my! Thank you so much, Rick. Soft-boiled eggs make
such a yummy snack.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="10">Hm? Hello. I haven't seen you around here before.
Are you a traveler here to scope out our local sights
and sounds?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="11">Oh, wait. Now that I think about it, I DID hear that
someone would be moving into that farm. I guess that's
you, huh?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You're &lt;playername&gt;? I'm Rick. Nice to meet you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="25">Here. Our chickens laid a ton of eggs, so I soft-boiled some
of them and ended up with a few too many to eat.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I don't want them to go to waste, so I figured I'd give
them to a fellow egg lover. If you want, that is.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="26">Good luck with everything on the farm.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="27">Ah. I'm sorry to hear that. Well, everyone has different
tastes, I suppose.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="28">Oh, and good luck with your farm work. If there's
anything I can do to help, just let me know.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="31">I like soft-boiled eggs because they're easy to make--just
pop 'em in hot water. But if you don't like them, oh well.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="32">Soft-boiled eggs are really, reeeally yummy!
I can't get enough! ♪&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="33">You don't like eggs, &lt;playername&gt;? Oh.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="34">Eggs are delicious, and there are so many ways to cook
them. Our whole family loves all kinds of egg dishes,
you see.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="35">Oh, dear. That's unfortunate. You don't like eggs at all?
Our eggs are especially flavorful, though...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="36">Have you two visited &lt;myfarmname&gt; Farm?
That plot is awfully big. It's rather impressive
that one person could run it on their own.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="37">Gosh, that place is huuuge! I can't even imagine
running it all by myself. I really respect that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

Come over here a sec.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="45">We were just talking about you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It really is awesome how you're running that huge farm
all by yourself.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="46">Yes, and at such a young age, too! It takes a special kind
of person to do that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="47">Farmers don't just raise crops. They also have to know
how to take care of livestock, too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="48">So, yeah, pop quiz! &lt;playername&gt;, can you tell me how
many days it takes a chicken egg to hatch?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="50">About three days!</Entry>
  <Entry Index="51">It takes one whole week!</Entry>
  <Entry Index="52">Correct! I figured a question that easy would be
a no-brainer for you. Good job.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

Boy, you take stuff seriously.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

of how much you love your work. That's what I think.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Just saying, you're a pretty awesome person,

  <Entry Index="60">Wow, I guess that was hard for you? Maybe you're a bit
greener with the whole chicken business than I thought.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="61">Well, too bad! Seems like you misremembered this time.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="62">Dear me. That's too bad. But don't fret. Everyone makes

someone I could really talk turkey--er, chicken with.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="68">Boy, &lt;playername&gt;, you really know your stuff!
I'm super impressed.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

and see him for a few minutes.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

Rick, maybe?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="80">Oh, hey, &lt;playername&gt;. What brings you up here?
Here to roll up your sleeves and help make my
floors spotless?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="81">Ha ha! No, I'd never ACTUALLY expect you to clean
my house. I was just messing with you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="82">Oh, by the way... I'm curious: do you have anything you'd
consider to be a personal treasure?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="86">See, I was dusting the shelves when I happened
to find something that I really used to treasure
when I was a kid.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="87">It's this wristwatch. Dad gave it to me a long time ago.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="88">But then he went off on a hunt for some flower that can
supposedly cure Mom's illness. He's been gone ever since.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
What's he doing? When'll he be back? We don't know,
because we haven't heard a word from him. I know Mom
misses him.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="89">Oh... Geez, I'm sorry. This watch dredged up some old
memories and I got wrapped up in thinking about Dad.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm boring you, I know.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="90">Yeaaah, it's kind of a buzzkill...</Entry>
  <Entry Index="91">You're not boring me at all.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="92">Yeaaah, it's kind of a buzzkill...</Entry>

  <Entry Index="98">Don't worry about what I said before, okay? It's nothing.
Oh, and please don't tell Mom or Popuri about this.
Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="99">Really...? I appreciate you saying that.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Something in my gut told me that I could open up
to you about that without boring or annoying you.
You're a good listener.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Here. If you want, you can have this watch.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

and Popuri? Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="106">Sorry I dumped all of my baggage on you earlier.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="107">Thanks for listening to me. Dad isn't here, and that's
that. I just have to step up and work that much harder.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

Man and husband.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="177">Now that we're officially married, what do you think
about giving each other special nicknames?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm okay with you just calling me "Rick," like always.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

  <Entry Index="186">My &lt;nickname&gt;! ∀ Well? Do you like the ring of it?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="187">You want me to call you something else? Sure. Like what?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="188">Gotcha. From now on, I'll call you &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="189">Okay. &lt;nickname&gt;, even though we're married now,
I still plan to work at the family chicken farm, like
always.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'll spend mornings and evenings here, though.
Are you okay with that?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="190">Yep, that's fine.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="191">No! Don't leave me!</Entry>
  <Entry Index="192">Thanks, &lt;nickname&gt;. I knew you'd understand.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="193">I wish I didn't have to, but I'm the only one who can look
after our chickens properly.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="198">Hm? Haven't seen you around before. Lemme guess:
you're the new gal who just moved into that old
farmhouse?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
&lt;playername&gt;, eh? Hi! I'm Kai. I run the Beach Cafe
here. Good to meetcha!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="199">Hm? Haven't seen you around before. Lemme guess:

  <Entry Index="200">Yo, &lt;playername&gt;! It's a real scorcher out there
today, eh? How you holdin' up? Me?
Just doin' a little cleaning.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="201">Hey, uh, Mr. Thomas mentioned something to me a while
back and it got me wonderin'.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Is it true that you split from your family and are living
here on your own?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="202">Huh. So you are, then. Oh, I don't mean any offense
by that. Honest.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I was just kinda surprised, y'know? One gal running a
whole farm all by her lonesome... That's awesome.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="203">Huh. So you are, then. Oh, I don't mean any offense
by that. Honest.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I was just kinda surprised, y'know? One guy running a
whole farm all by his lonesome... That's awesome.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="204">See, I've already moved outta my family's place too.
Do you think that's...I dunno, selfish of me? Be honest.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="205">Incorrigible! I can't believe you!</Entry>
  <Entry Index="206">Those who live in glass farmhouses...</Entry>
  <Entry Index="207">You can't, huh...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I've got my reasons, y'know. Just like I'm sure you've got
yours, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="208">Though I guess I CAN understand how some people would
see it as me bein' selfish and abandoning my parents or
something.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="209">Anyway, I'd better get back to cleanin'. Come on by my
Cafe if you ever have time. I'd love to see ya.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="210">Ah. So you're cool with it, huh? I'm glad you're not as
uptight as some people are when I bring this up.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="211">See, me and my folks're like oil and water. It's not that
we hate each other. Our lifestyles just don't mesh,
y'know?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="212">We should really sit down and shoot the breeze when
we've both got time. I bet we've got a lot in common.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="213">Welcome!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="214">Yo, &lt;playername&gt;! How's life on the farm? You tillin'
soil, plantin' seeds, all that good stuff?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="215">Really? Cool! Glad to hear things are going well for you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's weird. Knowing you're out there workin' hard gives
ME the energy to work hard too. Ha ha! Just kidding.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="216">So! You here for a bite to eat? Or are you just killin'
time?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="217">Hm? Your schedule opened up, so you came to hang out
and chat?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="218">Haha, awesome! As you can see, it's not like I have any
other customers, so a solid conversation sounds great
to me.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Come to think of it, I don't think I've asked what you
grow on your farm. What kinda crops do you have going?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="219">Pink Cats and stuff.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="220">Tons of Pineapples.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="221">I have something of a black thumb...</Entry>
  <Entry Index="222">Pink Cats, huh? Those are flowers, right?
They sure are pretty.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="223">See, I love everything summer, so if you're raising any
summer crops, I sure wouldn't say no to you bringing
me some.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="224">Dude, really? No way! Pineapple is one of my most
favorite foods ever!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="225">If you end up growing a good crop, I'd seriously love you
forever if you shared some with me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="226">Dude, really?! O-Oh, uh... Promise you
won't laugh?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="227">See, pineapple is actually one of my
most favorite foods ever.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="228">Thanks! ♪ To be honest, it's kinda embarrassing to admit.
I mean, folks tend to have...strong opinions on pineapple.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="229">I'm not asking you to give 'em to me for free, though.
Promise. If you hook me up, I'll hook YOU up in return.
Deal?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="230">I'll bend over backwards to help a bud who literally feeds
my pineapple addiction. Trust and believe.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="231">Uh, seriously? Nothing? Like, nada? Zip? Zilch? ...Oh, wait.
I get it. You only do livestock, then. Gotcha.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="232">Hey, it's your farm. You can do whatever you want
with it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="233">Huh. So you aren't raising any crops, then. That's too bad.
Kind of a waste, if ya ask me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="234">Huh. So you aren't raising any of those then, eh? Ah, well.
They DO take a lot of time and effort, after all.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="235">I love everything to do with summer, but pineapples?
Oh, man. Let's just say they have a special place
in my heart.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="236">If you're ever interested, why not try your hand at
growing some crops? Could be fun! You never know.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="237">Yo, &lt;playername&gt;! Whassup?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="238">Huh? Whoa! Dude, are you okay?! Hang in there!
I'll getcha to the Clinic right away! C'mon!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="239">Let's get you to the Clinic. C'mon!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="240">The patient is sleeping now. All symptoms have subsided,
so there is nothing to worry about. Well, for now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="241">Really? Thanks a million, Doctor.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="242">Eesh! Gave me a heart attack, that's for sure.
&lt;playername&gt; is usually healthy as a horse, but they
came tottering in...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...Then faceplanted right in front of me. I was terrified
they'd caught the plague or something.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="243">I must admit, I was awfully surprised by the ferocious
look on your face when you stormed in here with
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="244">Ah, yeah... Sorry about that. Didn't mean to make a fuss.
I was just totally focused on getting &lt;playername&gt;
here.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="245">Yes. I know you meant nothing by it. You were simply
worried for &lt;playername&gt;'s health.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="246">Well, uh...yeah. I mean, &lt;playername&gt; IS a valuable
member of our community, y'know? Who WOULDN'T
have freaked out?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="247">Everyone, &lt;playername&gt; has regained consciousness.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="248">Really? That's good to hear.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="249">Everyone, &lt;playername&gt; is awake now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="250">&lt;playername&gt;, how do you feel? Are you nauseated
at all? Does your head hurt?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="251">I see. As I suspected, you collapsed from mild heatstroke.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="252">The weather is particularly hot today. I think your farm
chores may have tired you out more than you realized.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="253">Heatstroke, eh? Never had it myself, knock on wood, but
you definitely need to watch out for it on days like this.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="254">&lt;playername&gt;, I strongly recommend that you get
plenty of fluids throughout the day. Maintain a healthy
diet, too.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If you still feel lightheaded, you may stay here and rest
as long as you need.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="255">Good. You don't look like death warmed over anymore.
That's a load off my mind, I'll tell you what.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Oh, but you should still get some rest.
No pushing yourself, got it?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="256">Okay, if you insist.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="257">Farming waits for no woman!</Entry>
  <Entry Index="258">Okay, if you insist.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="259">Farming waits for no man!</Entry>
  <Entry Index="260">I DO insist. You need it. I mean, when it's time to put your
nose to the grindstone, you really go all-out.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
That's why when it's time to rest, you ought to kick back
and rest like no one's ever rested before. 'Kay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="261">Oh yeah! Almost forgot. Here. This is... Well, it's a little
charm I got when I was traveling. You can have it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="262">I know running a farm can't be easy, but don't push
yourself too hard. Capisce?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="263">All right, then. I'd better go. You be sure to rest until
you're at 110%, y'hear? Don't make me come check
on you!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="264">*sigh* Listen, do you even remember collapsing? You
faceplanted. Right on the beach. It was ROUGH, dude.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If I hadn't come out when I did, you would've gotten baked
crispier than a tater tot under that hot sun.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="265">I know you're a hard worker who's serious about your
job, but you're gonna work yourself sick at this rate.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="266">Don't push yourself so hard all the time. It worries me
when you do that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="267">I mean, I guess you know your own limits better
than anyone. If you say you're fine, I'm not gonna
fight you on it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="268">Farm work is no joke, I know. Be careful and take care of
yourself, 'kay? For me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="269">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;! Over here!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="270">Yo, &lt;playername&gt;! Sorry, but the Cafe is closed
right now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="271">Nah, I'm not sick or anything. Just thought I'd take a
chance to mull over some stuff that's been on my mind.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="272">Don't worry, it's nothin' big. Anyway, why don't you take
a break and come watch the sea with me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="273">Maaan, nothin' really beats the smell of salt in your
nostrils and the sound of the ocean waves, huh?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="274">Sometimes, I wish I could just sit here, turn my brain off,
and gaze out across the water forever...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="275">Hm? Is something bothering me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="276">Ah. Sorry. I was trying not to worry you, but I guess I'm
not great at hiding when somethin' is eatin' at me, huh?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="277">Ugh. Heck with it. Stewing in it all by myself isn't getting
me anywhere, so I might as well ask you, if you'll listen.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="278">This'll probably seem like a dumb thing to be so worried
over, but it's been bugging me, okay?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
See, I know I talk all casual like this with everybody,
but apparently, some of the folks around here think
that's rude.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="279">Can't say I have the faintest clue what's wrong with it.
But it seems like it really rubs some folks the wrong way.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="280">Not that I particularly care what other people think of
me. I haven't ever felt the need to change myself to suit
them.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="281">But lately I've been wonderin' if I need to do
SOMETHING, if only to head off the weird ideas people
get about me.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
What do YOU think, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="282">Don't let it bother you.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="283">A different approach couldn't hurt.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="284">Don't change yourself for anyone.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="285">It's worth meeting them halfway.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="286">Don't let it bother me, eh? Y'know, it makes me feel
a whole lot better knowing you've got my back,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Yeah...you're right! There's nothing I need to get
so worked up over, is there? Thanks!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="287">The best thing I can do is to be true to myself. Changing
just to please others will make me miserable, no doubt.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="288">Don't change myself for them? Y'know, it makes me feel
a whole lot better knowing you've got my back,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Yeah...you're right! There's nothing I need to get
so worked up over, is there? Thanks!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="289">Huh... So I take it you agree with the others? You think
the way I'm casual with folks is actually kinda rude?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...Okay. I don't know how successful I'll be, but I'll see
what I can do to change things for the better.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="290">What, you think the way I talk is rude, too? Yikes... Gotta
say, I'm pretty shocked. Didn't expect that from you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...Okay. I don't know how successful I'll be, but I'll see
what I can do to change things for the better.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="291">Thanks for listening, &lt;playername&gt;. I'm glad I talked
to you about this.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="292">*sigh* Changing up how I talk to be more formal-like, eh?
That's gonna be tough.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="293">Okay, here oughta give us some privacy.
So...could you run that by me again?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And, uh... This isn't some kind of prank, is it?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="294">I know you're not that sorta person, but this is all so
sudden, y'know? It's kinda hard to swallow outta
nowhere.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="295">Haha... So it sounds like we've both been thinkin'
the same thing.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="296">Since we've been boyfriend and girlfriend, having you
around has just felt more and more natural, y'know?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I was startin' to hope that maybe things could go on like
this forever...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="301">Anyways, I'm gonna head back to the Cafe. I'll let the
mayor know, too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="302">So I guess the next thing to do is go and spread the word.
I'd like a ceremony, and a party for everyone, too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

Congratulations to you both!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

special gal.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

cool?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You can just keep calling me "Kai," like always.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But what do you want ME to call YOU?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="326">Gotcha! That settles that, then.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="327">Gotcha! That settles that, then.

I think I'll set down roots here in Mineral Town.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Mind if I commute from here to my Beach Cafe
every day?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Though...thinkin' about it, it'll be funny to have a summer

It's a pleasure to meet you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="338">You're &lt;playername&gt;, the one who moved onto that
farm, correct?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="339">Good heavens, if it isn't &lt;playername&gt;. Might I have
a moment of your time?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="340">Good heavens, if it isn't &lt;playername&gt;. Might I have
a moment of your time?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="341">To be honest, I have a request to make of you,
&lt;playername&gt;. Will you hear me out?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="342">To be honest, I have a request to make of you,
&lt;playername&gt;. Will you hear me out?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="343">Are you acquainted with the young man sitting in the
pew over there? His name is Cliff.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="344">Are you acquainted with the young man sitting in the
pew over there? His name is Cliff.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="345">My request concerns him, actually. Would you mind
striking up a conversation with him? Any topic will do,
I'm sure.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="346">The poor lamb came to this town all alone, just like
you did, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="347">But he has a hard time communicating with anyone
other than me, it seems.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
He plainly struggles in the realm of conversation,
the poor boy--particularly when it comes to speaking
up first.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="348">The poor lamb came to this town all alone, just like
you did, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="349">Oh, you'll do it? Bless you, child.
I wish you the best of luck.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="350">Oh... Hey...
Um, do you need something from me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="351">You're...&lt;playername&gt;?
I'm...Cliff.
Uh... Nice to meet you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="352">You're...&lt;playername&gt;?
I'm...Cliff.
Uh... Nice to meet you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="353">&lt;playername&gt;...
Uh... H-Hello.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="354">&lt;playername&gt;...
Uh... H-Hello.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="355">.........
.........Uh.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Wh-What is it? Is there...something on my face?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="356">Huh? You want...to talk?
With me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="357">Oh... Um, w-well, I...
U-Uh...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="358">I get so nervous, especially when I'm alone with someone.
I, uh, can't talk very well.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="359">Pull yourself together, man!</Entry>
  <Entry Index="360">Take your time.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="361">Pull yourself together, man!</Entry>
  <Entry Index="362">Take your time.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="363">Right... I'd, uh, like to, but...
It's...easier said than done, you know?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
So, um, I'm sorry, but...
I'd like to be alone. P-Please.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="364">...Yeah, I think I've calmed down now. Thank you,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="365">...Yeah, I think I've calmed down now. Thank you,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="366">I shouldn't worry about it? G-Gotcha. You're nice,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Speaking of which...you came to this town alone and are
running a farm all by yourself, right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="367">Incredible. I can't even imagine myself raising crops
or animals.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="368">It might be weird for me to say, but, uh, I'm sure it's
really hard, so...hang in there, okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="369">I shouldn't worry about it? G-Gotcha. You're nice,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Speaking of which...you came to this town alone and are
running a farm all by yourself, right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="370">And, uh... Not to be a bother, but would you mind talking
with me again sometime? O-Only if you get a chance,
that is.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="371">I'm, uh, really bad at talking with people, but if it's you,
&lt;playername&gt;...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="372">I'm, uh, really bad at talking with people, but if it's you,
&lt;playername&gt;...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="373">Ahem. Well, be careful on your way home.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="374">Oh, if it isn't &lt;playername&gt;.
Perfect timing.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="375">Oh, if it isn't &lt;playername&gt;.
Perfect timing.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="376">Cliff and I were just making plans to have supper
together here today.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="377">If you don't have dinner plans, would you...like to join us,
&lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="378">If you don't have dinner plans, would you...like to join us,
&lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="379">It'd be nice to eat together with you, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="380">It'd be nice to eat together with you, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="381">We're planning on having Ran bring food from the Inn.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Would you two mind helping to clean up before she
arrives?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'll be in the Confessional, so if anyone comes, let me know.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="382">Ugh, Carter... You don't have to clean, &lt;playername&gt;.
I'll take care of it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="383">Ugh, Carter... You don't have to clean, &lt;playername&gt;.
I'll take care of it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="384">Good, because I was about to say...</Entry>
  <Entry Index="385">I'd like to help.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="386">Then I'll kick back while you clean.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="387">It'll be good exercise.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="388">Then, uh... Just wait outside until I'm done, okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="389">Whoa! You almost scared the broom bristles off of me!
...Wait, is that you, &lt;playername&gt;?!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="390">Sorry, I was barreling along and didn't expect anyone
to be in front of the Church.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="391">Whoa! You almost scared the broom bristles off of me!
...Wait, is that you, &lt;playername&gt;?!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="392">Oh...he invited you over, huh? So THAT'S why you were
out here. Haha. Sorry to keep you waiting for dinner.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I didn't realize you and Cliff were that close, though.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="393">I mean, Cliff basically only talks to Carter, you know?
He's the quintessential keeps-to-himself type.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="394">That's why I've been a little worried about him.
But I guess I didn't need to be, huh?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="395">Oh...he invited you over, huh? So THAT'S why you were
out here. Haha. Sorry to keep you waiting for dinner.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I didn't realize you and Cliff were that close, though.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="396">Well, let's head in before the food gets cold.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="397">Oh, Ran. I see you've brought our food.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="398">Cliff just finished cleaning, too. You have most excellent
timing.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="399">Thanks for bringing it, Ran.
And...sorry for the wait, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="400">Now, let's dig in while it's still hot.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="401">Thanks for bringing it, Ran.
And...sorry for the wait, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="402">It was nice eating together.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="403">Y-Yeah? That's awfully nice of you. Then if you wouldn't
mind lending a hand with this...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="404">You'll help just for the exercise? Hahaha. Okay, then.
I'd be glad to take you up on that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="405">Oh...sorry for staring. I was just thinking that, um...
You're really skilled with your hands.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And I couldn't help wondering...if you work this quickly
on the farm, too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="406">Oh...sorry for staring. I was just thinking that, um...
You're really skilled with your hands.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And I couldn't help wondering...if you work this quickly
on the farm, too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="407">Tending to the fields and animals...
Rushing to town, then to the forest...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="408">Hahaha, I guess doing that every day really WOULD
teach you how to make the most of your time in a hurry.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="409">Evening! Delivery! Whooo's hungry?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="410">Well, the food's here, so let's put the cleaning on pause
for now. I'll go get Carter.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="411">Oh... Hello, Duke.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="412">Good job today, Cliff. Your work ethic never fails to
impress. Don't hesitate to take a breather if you need it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="413">No need to worry... I'm fine.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="414">Manna is one step ahead of you, I'm afraid--she's
concerned you might collapse from overwork.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="415">What? No, I'm fine, really, so... Please don't work
yourselves up over me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="416">"Don't work ourselves up"?
Now see here, Cliff...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="417">Well, if it isn't &lt;playername&gt;.
Don't just stand over there. Come here.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="418">You're right on cue. Cliff, why don't you mosey on over to
Mother's Hill with &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
With the beautiful weather we're having today, I'm sure
there'll be a great view from the peak.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="419">What? But I still have work to--&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="420">Let me stop you right there. You've already done your
fair share of work for today. I'll finish up the rest.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="421">But...I can't let you do that. I took on this job, so I have to
see it to--&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="422">Cliff. If I recall correctly...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...you haven't properly thanked &lt;playername&gt; for
helping you land this job in the first place.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Listen to me when I say to take advantage of this
opportunity. Please humor me on this, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="423">...Okay, you win. I'll go.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="424">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;, look.
A rabbit.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="425">It's so nice to see one up close.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="426">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;, look.
A rabbit.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="427">Oh... It ran away. That's too bad. I wanted to watch
it a while longer.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="428">We're finally here.
Are you okay, &lt;playername&gt;?
Um, you're not tired, are you?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="429">We're finally here.
Are you okay, &lt;playername&gt;?
Um, you're not tired, are you?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="430">What's that? Working on the farm has toughened you up
enough to make this a cakewalk? Well, that's good to
hear.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="431">That Duke... Well, he can be a little bossy at times, so...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I was worried that I'd dragged you into this and ruined
your day, or something...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="432">That Duke... Well, he can be a little bossy at times, so...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I was worried that I'd dragged you into this and ruined
your day, or something...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="433">But I guess it's not so bad that he gave me an extra push.
It's true that I haven't thanked you yet, after all.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
&lt;playername&gt;...
Thank you. Seriously.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's because of you that I've started to envision
something of a life for myself here in this town.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="434">But I guess it's not so bad that he gave me an extra push.
It's true that I haven't thanked you yet, after all.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
&lt;playername&gt;...
Thank you. Seriously.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's because of you that I've started to envision
something of a life for myself here in this town.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="435">Little by little, I've started getting used to this job.
Heck, I think I'm even enjoying it at this point.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="436">Yeah...
Hey, uh, &lt;playername&gt;...
Do you...like the work you do?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="437">Yeah...
Hey, uh, &lt;playername&gt;...
Do you...like the work you do?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="438">Yo hoe, a farmer's life for me!</Entry>
  <Entry Index="439">I've never thought about it.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="440">I think it's my calling.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="441">My opinion is still germinating.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="442">Th-That satisfying, huh? I think I've come to like my work,
too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="443">The fruit I pick gets turned into wine that so many
people end up enjoying. Just thinking about it is so...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I've never felt this way before. When I make that
connection, it's like...like my effort actually means
something.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="444">I'm still not very good at it, though. I'm sure I've given
Duke and Manna my fair share of headaches from
messing up.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="445">Um, I know this is sudden, but...here. I made this
to thank you for everything. You're welcome to
have it, if you want.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="446">W-Well, I guess I'll head back.
I'm worried about Duke.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="447">O-Oh... I guess that was a bad question. Sorry for asking...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="448">W-Well, I guess I'll head back.
I'm worried about Duke.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="449">...Wonder what...is thinking?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="450">Well, it's...problem. So you need to stay out of it, dear.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="451">But...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="452">Aren't you worried about Cliff?
You just saw, didn't you? He...
...And then...so...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="453">I know. I can't say I'm not worried.
Cliff...and... It's such a shock.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="454">That's exactly why we need to confront him about it!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="455">I told you!
It's between them!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm concerned about Cliff myself, trust me.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But I'd rather wait and see than stick my nose where it
doesn't belong and only succeed in making things worse!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Even if you asked him about it, what advice could YOU
possibly give?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="456">O-Oh! Hey!
Fancy seeing you here, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="457">Hello, &lt;playername&gt;.
You didn't happen to overhear what we were just talking
about, did you?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="458">...You couldn't hear what we were saying? Well, I assure
you we weren't fighting.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="459">We're just of two minds on something--typical for a
married couple, I assure you. Sorry if we made you
uncomfortable.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="460">&lt;playername&gt;, may I ask you something?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="461">Good grief, dear! Just drop it. Can't you for ONE second
realize when you're overstepping your boundaries?!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="462">Oh, shut your trap! What's wrong with being worried
about your own family?!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="463">*sigh* I'm done.
Do whatever you want.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="464">I'm so sorry, &lt;playername&gt;.
To be honest...it's about Cliff.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
What would you say is his weakness?
I know it's out of the blue, but what's the first thing that
comes to mind?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="465">He overthinks things.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="466">Cliff? No weaknesses detected.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="467">Exactly! You know him so well, &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="468">I can't argue that, dear. He's bottled up and corked
tighter than our finest vintage.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
We'd love it if he'd confide in us, but it's impossible to
coax anything out of him. It's frustrating.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="469">No, no. It's great to celebrate a person's strengths, but
you have to be aware of their weaknesses, too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="470">Actually, sorry. This is between us.
So don't worry about it, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="471">Duke. Manna.
I've finished my work for today.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Oh, hello, &lt;playername&gt;.
You have business at the store?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="472">Duke. Manna.
I've finished my work for today.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Oh, hello, &lt;playername&gt;.
You have business at the store?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="473">H-Hey! Good job, Cliff.
Thanks for putting in 110%, as always.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="474">&lt;playername&gt; was JUST talking about having supper
with you at the Inn today. Weren't you,
&lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="475">Huh? Y-You came all the way here for that?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="476">That's right, Cliff.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="477">You've finished your work, so scoot! We'll handle it from
here.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="478">Yes, sir. Thank you. Well, &lt;playername&gt;, should we
get going?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="479">Yes, sir. Thank you. Well, &lt;playername&gt;, should we
get going?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="480">Today's special really hit the spot.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="481">I mean, it's always really good, but...
Today was on another level. I wonder why.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="482">Is it because I'm with you, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="483">It's gotta be...
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="484">Hey...&lt;playername&gt;.
There's something I want to ask you.
Do you mind?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="485">Is it because I'm with you, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="486">Hey...&lt;playername&gt;.
There's something I want to ask you.
Do you mind?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="487">Back at work, before I came in to report that I was done,
you three were talking about something, right?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but I did
overhear bits and pieces...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I only heard my name, really...and then I noticed that Duke
and Manna were acting odd.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="488">Could it be that I...caused trouble for them again without
even realizing it?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="489">They're worried about you.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="490">You're important to them.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="491">Worried... Yeah, I can see why...
I still have a lot to learn, so I'm sure they feel like they
can't rely on me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="492">Thank you for telling me. I'll be sure to work extra hard
from now on.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="493">I'm...important to them? Huh? We're not even family,
so why would they...?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="494">But if that's true... I'm so happy that I'm at a loss for
words. I don't feel like I deserve it, honestly.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="495">Thank you so much for today, &lt;playername&gt;. Being
with you stirs something in me that I can't explain.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="496">I...hope you'll invite me out again sometime.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="497">Thank you so much for today, &lt;playername&gt;.
I had a lot of fun.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="498">Does Cliff really think that...?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="499">Just look at what you've wrought.
Your impulsiveness has made everything awkward.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="500">Yeah... I thought setting them up was a good idea,
but I guess I jumped the gun.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="501">Excuse us, &lt;playername&gt;.
It seems we were mistaken.
Please don't worry about it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="502">Well, no matter what sort of feelings you harbor
for Cliff, it doesn't change the fact that you two get
along well.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="503">I leave Ran to you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="504">What is it? You here for some food?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="505">Phew... I think we'll be fine here.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="506">So...about what you brought up earlier...
U-Uh...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="507">I'm not...misunderstanding, right?
If you're serious, could you show that to me once more?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="508">It's true. It's really true... It's almost hard to believe, but
the evidence stands before my eyes. I'm so happy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="509">Meeting you changed my life forever. You were the first
person to ever quiet the voice of my inner saboteur.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I couldn't stop thinking about you. About the woman
who made me want to stay in this town forever.
And here we are.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="510">Meeting you changed my life forever. You were the first
person to ever quiet the voice of my inner saboteur.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I couldn't stop thinking about you. About the man
who made me want to stay in this town forever.
And here we are.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="511">"Am I good enough for her?" I can't help but wonder.
But if you'll have me, I'd be honored to be
your husband.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="512">"Am I good enough for him?" I can't help but wonder.
But if you'll have me, I'd be honored to be
your husband.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="513">To have my dreams become reality so suddenly...
Do I even deserve to be this happy?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="514">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;. I'd like to tell Duke and Manna...
And Carter, too.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It shouldn't take long.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="516">Cliff... I'm so happy for you.
I was waiting for this day to come.
Congratulations.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="517">What? Are you crying, dear? You should be marking this
occasion with congratulations, not tears!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="518">But it's just that Cliff--Cliff, of all people--has finally
found happiness. I can't help but feel emotional.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="519">My, my. Congratulations, Cliff.
I'm glad to see you have people who care so deeply
about you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="520">Yeah...
Duke...and Manna...
And you too, Carter.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Thank you so much for always thinking of me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="525">We need to prepare the venue and contact
the townspeople, so it'll be about a week.
Leave everything to me, Cliff!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="526">I can't tell you how much that means to me, Duke...
Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

happily ever after!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

I wish you two nothing but happiness!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

I'm fine with you continuing to call me "Cliff."&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But what should I call you, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="541">Yeah. Okay.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

Like what, for instance?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="545">Okay. I'll call you &lt;nickname&gt; from now on. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="546">About our new life together, &lt;nickname&gt;...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I plan to live here, of course, but would you mind if I kept
working at the Vineyard?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="547">Thanks, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="548">Sorry. It's just that I finally found a job, so I don't want
to quit it.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I promise I'll be home in the mornings and evenings, okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="549">So, um, yeah, &lt;nickname&gt;. ∀
Here's to our new life together.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="550">So, um, yeah, &lt;nickname&gt;. ∀
Here's to our new life together.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="551">Why?! Tell me what's wrong with it!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="552">TELL you? Fool! Look within. You already have the
answer. If you can't even understand that...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="553">What? What're you looking at? If you don't have any
business here, then...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="554">Gray! How dare you address a customer in such
an impertinent manner!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="555">Oh... S-Sorry.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="556">Welcome.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="557">Ah, so you're &lt;playername&gt;. You're the one who
recently took over that farm.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
My name is Saibara.
This boy here's my grandson, Gray.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="558">...Yup. Nice to meetcha.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="559">Oh, if it isn't &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Perfect timing. This boy here's my grandson, Gray.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Come now, Gray. Say hello.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="560">Oh...it's you, &lt;playername&gt;.
...Hello.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="561">What, you know each other?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Ah, could you be &lt;playername&gt;?
The one who took over that farm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="562">I see. My name is Saibara.
I work here as a blacksmith.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Now, then...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="563">Oh...it's you, &lt;playername&gt;.
...Hello.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="564">&lt;playername&gt;, hm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="565">I'm going to take a break.
You deal with our customer.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="566">Sorry 'bout earlier.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="567">*sigh* You shouldn't have had to walk into that. As you no
doubt heard, he was telling me to redo my work.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I hafta fight for so much as a scrap of encouragement or
praise from Grandpa.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="568">It's like this every day.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Like, to the point that I'm not sure I wanna keep
going anymore.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="569">Steel your resolve. Chin up.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="570">Then just quit, dude.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="571">Y'know, you're right. I'm just acting spoiled.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="572">Um, sorry. I don't know where I get off complainin'
to you about all this.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="573">I appreciate the boost, &lt;playername&gt;.
Even if I still don't really understand what Grandpa's
trying to teach me.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But I'll keep working at it. I hafta trust that
I'll get it someday.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="574">I oughta get back to work.
Catch ya later.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="575">What?! Comin' from someone who doesn't know a flange
from a fillet...! Rrgh, I guess I shouldn'ta complained, but...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="576">Y'know, I hate to ask, but could you gimme some space
here and head home?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="577">I'm training right now. Sorry.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="578">Feel free to read any book that catches your eye.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="579">Ah... Hey, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="580">&lt;playername&gt;...
Uh...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="581">There's something I'd like to talk to you about,
if you've got a sec.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Um... Sorry for yelling a while back.
I shouldn't have treated a customer like that.
I really regret it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="582">Th-Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="583">I get like that with people I don't know very well.
My temper flares up faster than copper
in a blazin' forge.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="584">But I'd hate to know that you thought badly of me
because of one blow-up.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Hope you can accept my apology for all that mess.
We good?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="585">Oh, that reminds me! You ship ore and ore-adjacent stuff,
right, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="586">It's probably no surprise given my line of work,
but I love ore and gems.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
So I was thinking of trying to make some stuff in secret.
Y'know, without Grandpa catching wind.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I need to crank my training up to max heat
if I wanna improve.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="587">That's only natural, I'd think.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="588">I'm applying to your fan club. Stat.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="589">R-Right. It's...only natural.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
S-Still, believe me when I say I'm gonna work hard.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="590">Once I've had a chance to hone my skills a bit, mind if I try
makin' something for you, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="591">Right on. Just you wait and see.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="592">It's not that big of a deal.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I've still got a long way to go, but I'm hopin' I can leave
even Grandpa in the dust someday. In smithing, I mean.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Once I've had a chance to hone my skills a bit, I'll make
somethin' especially for you, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="593">K-Keep in mind that I'm only gonna show you if it turns
out right, so don't get your hopes up too high.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But...I'll do my best.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="594">Oh... Need something?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="595">I'm turning up the heat on my training.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="596">Hello, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="597">Grandpa chewed me out again today.
I'm not letting it get to me, though.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
In fact, I actually think I'm starting to understand why
he's so hard on me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="598">Maybe I'm finally startin' to think and act
like a full-fledged blacksmith.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="599">There's something I'm biting at the bit to ask
you today, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="600">I don't often see you wearin' jewelry or anything
like that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="601">A-Are you not really interested in that kinda stuff?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="602">I live to be adorned in opulence!</Entry>
  <Entry Index="603">Have you SEEN the dirt under my nails?</Entry>
  <Entry Index="604">Figured. There're probably plenty of girls out there
who'd say something similar. Maybe in a less...weird way.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="605">Oh, no, I didn't mean anything bad by that. Honest.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="606">Um... Are you angry?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="607">That's good.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="608">There's a reason I came here today.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I wanted to give you this.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="609">It's a brooch I made that I thought'd look nice on you.
Hope you like it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="610">A-Are you interested in fashion at all, 
&lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="611">I live to be adorned in opulence!</Entry>
  <Entry Index="612">Have you SEEN the dirt under my nails?</Entry>
  <Entry Index="613">Oh, yeah? That's good to hear.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="614">Here. It's a bracelet I made that I thought'd look
nice on you. Hope you like it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="615">I was worried that maybe you didn't need it.
I'm glad you seem to like it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="616">I made that from scratch--all by myself--without
Grandpa knowing.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
He's still way better than me, but I'm at least
at the point in my training where I can make simple
stuff like this.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I figured that if it turned out well,
I'd give it to you, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="617">It'd really mean a lot to me to see you get some use
out of it. Well, see you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="618">Take good care of it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="619">O-Oh... Okay.
I'm, uh...gonna head back now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="620">Good to see you, &lt;playername&gt;.
Could you come here for a minute?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="621">It would seem you've been getting on well with my Gray,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
No doubt he's inherited my aloof demeanor, so I've been
worried he might be struggling to make friends, but...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm glad to see he's taken a shine to you,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="622">Gray's become increasingly passionate about his training
as of late. I've been impressed by his diligence.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But something seems to be weighing on his heart.
That much is clear from the tools he produces.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="623">Gray!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="624">What, Grandpa?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Oh, &lt;playername&gt;. Welcome.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="625">Gray, you may leave for today.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="626">What're you talking about?
You never let me leave early.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="627">I've determined that &lt;playername&gt; is the cause of
your emotional distress.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I apologize, &lt;playername&gt;, but could you spare some
time to spend with him today?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="628">I apologize, &lt;playername&gt;, but could you spare some
time to spend with him today?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="629">Sorry... Grandpa says crazy stuff outta the blue
every once in a while. Guess you got caught in the
crossfire today.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="630">Um... Hey. I guess this is a good enough time to ask.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Are you planning on staying in this town long-term,
&lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="631">Couldn't imagine life anywhere else!</Entry>
  <Entry Index="632">Who knows what tomorrow will bring.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="633">Oh! Oh, man, talk about a relief.
Er, wait... I mean...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="634">Some people only stick around here for a certain amount
of time, like Kai. Kinda like a...reverse snowbird, y'know?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Others, like my old man, end up moving to another
town altogether.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
That's why I've been curious about what you're
gonna do, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="635">In other words...
What I'm tryin' to say is...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="636">I'd miss you if you went away.
I...don't have many other friends.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And I've especially, um...never been friends with a girl
before, so...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="637">A-Anyway... If you're staying here, I hope you'll keep bein'
my friend.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="638">I admit this has been on my mind.
I...feel like I can breathe easy now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="639">I'd miss you if you went away. I...don't have many other
friends. Especially not someone as special as you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="640">So there's a possibility you could leave, then?
Oh... All right...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
No... It's nothing. Just figured I'd ask.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
See ya.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="641">No... It's nothing. Just figured I'd ask.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="642">Well, see ya around.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="643">Let's chat again soon, yeah?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="644">...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="645">No one will bother us here.
About what you said earlier...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Are you...serious?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="646">Huh...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="647">Actually, ever since we started dating, I knew this could
happen someday, but my low self-esteem told me
otherwise.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Yet at the same time, my heart was telling me that with
a girlfriend like you by my side...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...I might find the strength to push past whatever's been
holding me back.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

Congratulations, Gray.

He may still be wet behind the ears, but I hope you'll take
good care of my grandson.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

In front of the person I'm gonna marry?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="658">But of course, my boy.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Now matter how much you mature, or how skilled
of a blacksmith you become, you will always be
my little Gray.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You're my beloved grandson. Don't ever forget that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="659">Ah...!
Sheesh, Grandpa...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="660">Now, that's quite enough of that.
This isn't the time to be misty-eyed.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I wish you and my grandson every happiness,
&lt;playername&gt;. He is lucky to have found a woman
like you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

took together will make for great memories, too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="674">Grandpa cried in the end.
Seeing him like that really hit me hard.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="675">We'll be living together in this house from now on.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="676">Uh, I've been wondering... Should we change the names
we call each other?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You can call me whatever you want.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But what do YOU wanna be called, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="677">Uh... &lt;nickname&gt;. All right.
Then that's what I'll say from now on.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="678">What name sounds good to you?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="679">&lt;nickname&gt;, huh? ∀ 
Yeah, gotta admit, I like the ring of that.
Here's to our new life together.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="680">Just so you know, I'm planning to continue working as
a blacksmith even now that we're married.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="681">Thanks, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="682">Well, &lt;nickname&gt;, tomorrow marks the start
of our new life together. I can already tell this
is gonna be great.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="683">Oh? Pardon me. I didn't realize I still had a patient
to see.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="684">You're not from this town, are you?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="685">Ah, I see. So you're &lt;playername&gt;, the new caretaker
of that farm. There have been rumors floating around
about you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
My name is Doctor. And as you can see, I'm a physician.
If you ever feel unwell, do seek me out right away.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="686">My name is Doctor. And as you can see, I'm a physician.
If you ever feel unwell, do seek me out right away.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="687">Ah, if it isn't &lt;playername&gt;.
Are you eating well?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="688">That's good to hear. A balanced diet is critical
to cultivating a strong, healthy body.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="689">Most people in this town are healthy.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
We live in a place where the abundant blessings of
nature appear to have rendered most diseases impotent.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="690">But I still study each and every day. Medicine is an
endless pursuit. Many problems remain unsolved,
even now.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
What about you, &lt;playername&gt;? Working on the
farm is surely a difficult endeavor in its own right.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Farm work is one of the most physically demanding jobs
out there. Do take care.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Also, for medical matters you'd rather not discuss with
me, you may speak to my nurse, Elly.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
In any case, we are always here to lend an ear about any
health concerns you may have.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="692">Oh! That's right, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I just received some medicine from another town.
Would you like to try some?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Unlike the medicine typically sold here, it can restore
both stamina and fatigue at the same time.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="693">Its only fault is that the effect is somewhat weak, which
is why it hasn't been put out on the market yet.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I improved it to increase its effectiveness,
albeit at the expense of flavor.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="694">Yeaaah, I'll pass.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="695">A little medicine never hurt anyone...</Entry>
  <Entry Index="696">It is often said that there is an inverse relationship
between taste and efficacy, so I'm confident it will work.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Even I take some when I'm tired.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="697">I apologize for trying to force you. I thought that as the
owner of a farm, you might be interested in it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="698">Y-You do not have to look so pained.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="699">However, you must not overestimate your own abilities.
An abundance of pride will lead to your downfall.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="700">Oh ho. It would seem I sized you up correctly. Go on, then.
Down it in one gulp.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="701">Ah, so it tastes as awful as I expected.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="702">But it WAS rather effective, yes?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="703">I had hypothesized that you'd be able to see the value
in this medicine. Would you like some more?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="704">Haha, forgive me. I couldn't resist a little joke. Taking too
much of any medicine can have negative effects.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="705">Thank you for today, &lt;playername&gt;.
You've given me a lot to consider.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="706">Are you quite sure? You won't regret it?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="707">You've a rather adventurous spirit, I must say.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="708">Hm? You didn't take any?
Well, I can't say I blame you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="709">The doctor is passionate about his research.
I could stand to learn a lot from him.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="710">&lt;playername&gt;, you came at just the perfect time.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="711">Another new medicine arrived today.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="712">Run awaaay!</Entry>
  <Entry Index="713">Ooh, yay! Untested substances!</Entry>
  <Entry Index="714">O-Oh, &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="715">I've never seen anyone run so fast.
Did I do something wrong?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="716">Aha! I knew you'd be interested!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Pardon me for just a moment. I'll go fetch it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="717">Just like before, this medicine recovers stamina and
fatigue at the same time, but with twice the efficacy.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Now, &lt;playername&gt;: all in one gulp!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="718">Ah, but I should warn you about the flavor.
It tastes as horrible as the last one.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="719">However, I trust that you will understand the benefits
of this medicine.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="720">I admire your maturity! Now, go ahead and take it,
if you will.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="721">How do you feel?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="722">&lt;playername&gt;!
Stay with me!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="723">Elly, come here! Quickly!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="724">Yes, sir!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="725">I sincerely apologize for today.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
As a physician, I never should have subjected you
to such peril.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="726">It seems the stimulus was too potent. And yet, no such
thing happened when I drank it...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="727">I truly apologize. I went too far.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="728">You seem to be feeling better now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="729">What's most important is that there seem to have been
no long-term effects.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="730">Doctor, please refrain from carelessly testing new
medicine on your patients from now on.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="731">Yes, I'm sorry. I inconvenienced you as well, Elly.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="732">&lt;playername&gt;, I cannot apologize enough for today.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I took advantage of your willingness to help me advance
my study of medicine, and for that, I apologize.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="733">Please do not let this sour our budding relationship.
I hope to see you again sometime.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="734">Take care, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="735">Don't push yourself too hard, okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="736">If you feel ill, come see us immediately.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="737">Hello, &lt;playername&gt;.
Are you working hard on your farm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="738">Well, I'm glad to hear that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="739">Oh, by the way, Doctor said he had something to give you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="740">What could it be?</Entry>
  <Entry Index="741">Past trauma...is flooding back...</Entry>
  <Entry Index="742">There's no need to worry. It's all above board this time.
Even I wouldn't mind having it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="743">In any case, please go see him.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="744">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;.
I've been waiting for you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Today, I was thinking I'd give you something I've kept
tucked away.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Until now, I've been putting all my effort into
researching new medicine while doing checkups
on the side.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And most recently, I've been researching...this.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="745">It doesn't QUITE fall within the realm of medical care,
but it's already garnered some popularity among
city folk.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="746">So I'd like the people of Mineral Town to know about it.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And to that end, I need someone to try it out.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Since you work the hardest day in and day out, I thought
I'd make the request of you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="747">It's called negative ionization therapy, and when applied,
it supposedly has a relaxing effect.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
When a person basks in negative ions, their mental state
becomes calmer, and they're able to relax more easily.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
For example, when you take a stroll through the forest,
you feel refreshed, correct?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
That is because forested areas produce a multitude
of negative ions.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="748">I'm glad you seem pleased.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Mind over matter, as they say. It just goes to show how
strongly the heart and body are connected.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I've begun to think that the optimal route to wellness is
living optimistically and minimizing stress.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="749">Of course, there are also people like Lillia, who are born
with an illness.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I plan to continue my research for the sake of people
like her.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="750">Hm? You're impressed that I care so deeply about
my patients?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
No, no. I'm only doing what any good physician would.
It's my job.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Still, hearing you say that...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="751">At my age, I hardly ever receive such frank compliments.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
So it's a little embarrassing to have you say that aloud.
Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="752">Let us both continue to pursue our respective passions.
Do tell me if the therapy has noticeable effects.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="753">You don't seem to be terribly enthused.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I won't force you to do it, but please try to consider
Doctor's feelings.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="754">The field of medicine is inspirational. I hope to always
retain this enthusiasm for learning.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="755">How nice! Maybe I'll try it myself.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="756">&lt;playername&gt;, could you come here for a moment?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="757">Doctor's acting strangely. He seems to be lost in thought
and has a permanent scowl plastered on his face.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I tried talking to him, but he won't so much as
acknowledge me.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If you don't have any plans today, could you try speaking
with him?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="758">Thank you. If you would, please.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="759">Oh, it's you. Hm? Elly is worried about me?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Ah, I hate to have troubled her.
I've been deep in thought today.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="760">I was thinking about how I interact with my patients.
Apparently, something about me makes me difficult
to approach.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I was wondering if there might be something I can
do to that end. What do you think?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="761">Open up your heart.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="762">Physicians should have boundaries.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="763">Open up...my heart, you say? I see.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You have rightly assessed that I am the type of man who
doesn't freely speak with others.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Perhaps from their point of view, I have erected a wall
between us.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="764">It's strange. I've never spoken of my worries with
someone else before, and yet...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Somehow, I feel more at ease when I'm with you,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="765">For whatever reason, I'm not compelled to hide anything
from you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="766">Yes... I understand now. This is what it means to open
one's heart.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="767">It's strange. I've never spoken of my worries with
someone else before, and yet I can easily discuss them
with you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="768">Thank you. Your reassurance gives me confidence.
I'll continue to work hard.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="769">Hmmm... Do you truly think so, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But I'd rather not have things continue as they are.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I must think of some way...
At any rate, I apologize for troubling you with such
a strange question.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="770">Thank you, &lt;playername&gt;. I'll do my best
to start opening up.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="771">It is difficult to change oneself.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="772">This is the first time I've ever seen him like this.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="773">Now he looks even MORE pensive.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="774">No one should disturb us here.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
About what you mentioned earlier...
Are you serious?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I mean...about marrying me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="775">No one should disturb us here.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
About what you mentioned earlier...
Are you serious?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I mean...about marrying me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="776">For some reason, my brain refuses to accept this
as reality.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="777">Even if it IS the future I've imagined ever since
we began dating.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
For all my expertise in the realm of medicine,
I still flounder in matters of the heart.
I admit I was biding my time.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If you are willing to put up with me, then of course
my answer is yes. Will you marry me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="779">Aah... I feel as though I'm dreaming.
Let us pursue happiness together,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="780">Well, then. I'm returning to the Clinic. Please leave all the
wedding preparations to me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="781">Oh, so you two are getting married?
Congratulations!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="782">Oh, so you two are getting married?
Congratulations!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="783">We owe this to the Goddess' guidance.
May you two find eternal happiness.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Ever since I saw you two speaking so intimately at
Doctor's house...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...I was sure that you would one day tie the knot.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It will be an honor to officiate a wedding between two of
my dear friends.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

Best wishes as you enter this new stage of life together!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="794">What a lovely ceremony. It was the best medicine
I could've asked for today.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="795">&lt;playername&gt;, let us do our best to support
one another.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I am sure that together, we are capable of overcoming
any obstacle.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="796">So we're finally home. Phew... I'm exhausted.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="797">But I had a grand time. The ceremony, the reception...
Everyone did so much for us that I almost feel guilty.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="798">And now...our life together begins.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="799">On that note...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
What should I call you from now on?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="800">Understood, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="801">You would like some other name?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="935">Okay. I don't think anyone will bother us here.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="936">Just to make sure I'm not misunderstanding, you're
saying you want to be boyfriend and girlfriend, right?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Man...to think you would beat me to the punch...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="937">Just to make sure I'm not misunderstanding, you're
saying you want to be boyfriends, right?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Man...to think you would beat me to the punch...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="938">Of COURSE my answer is yes. I'm thrilled that you want
us to be together!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="939">&lt;playername&gt;, you have no idea how happy this
makes me. I'm your boyfriend...! Really, the pleasure's
all mine.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="940">&lt;playername&gt;, you have no idea how happy this
makes me. I'm your boyfriend...! Really, the pleasure's
all mine.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="941">Anyway, I'd better get back to work.
See you around!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="942">OMELETS ALMIGHTY! &lt;playername&gt;!
What are you doing there?!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="943">OMELETS ALMIGHTY! &lt;playername&gt;!
What are you doing there?!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="944">No. It's okay. I'm the one who should be apologizing.
I was in such a rush that I didn't even see you there.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="945">Anyway, I'm really glad you stopped by, but I'm busy right
now and I don't think I can get free.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I've finished cataloging our inventory, but now I have to
feed the chickens.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Popuri has taken off to who-knows-where, too, so I can't
even help you at the storefront right now, and--&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="946">What? You'll help me feed the chickens?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="947">Well, um, I appreciate the thought, but you're a guest
here. I can't ask you to handle store work for me...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="948">Well, um, I appreciate the thought, but you're a guest
here. I can't ask you to handle store work for me...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="949">&lt;playername&gt;... Yeah, you have a point. Now is exactly
the sort of time I should be leaning on my girlfriend for
help.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="950">&lt;playername&gt;... Yeah, you have a point. Now is exactly
the sort of time I should be leaning on my boyfriend for
help.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="951">Okay, then. If you really don't mind, I'd appreciate
whatever help you can give me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="952">Okay, then. If you really don't mind, I'd appreciate
whatever help you can give me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="953">Hey, come back here! Stop creating extra work for
&lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="954">Hey, come back here! Stop creating extra work for
&lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="955">Wow, &lt;playername&gt;! Amazing! That one's so shy
that she always runs away. I have the hardest time
wrangling her.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="956">Wow, &lt;playername&gt;! Amazing! That one's so shy
that she always runs away. I have the hardest time

  <Entry Index="957">That's a farmer for you. You're used to caring for
livestock. I guess I don't have to give you directions, huh?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="958">*sigh* Me, on the other hand... I have both
the store and the chickens to tend to,
and I can't manage either right.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="959">You're doing your best, babe.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="960">Guess you've gotta try harder.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="961">Ahahaha... I guess so. It feels really nice to hear you
say that, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="962">Ahahaha... I guess so. It feels really nice to hear you
say that, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="963">Man, I have no idea what I would've done if you hadn't
come along, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I bet I would've panicked and rushed around in a tizzy,
making a mess of things left and right.&lt;wait&gt;

  <Entry Index="965">Thanks a lot for your help today.
I sincerely needed it, and...it felt good to have you there.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="966">Huh! YOU two sure have gotten extra super friendly
lately, &lt;playername&gt; and Rick.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="967">My, my! You certainly do seem very, very close
these days.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="968">Mom?! Popuri?! Where the heck have you been?
Do you have any idea how much trouble I've been
having all by myself?!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="969">I'm sorry, Rick. But it looks like you had a great time
with &lt;playername&gt;, so it couldn't have been ALL bad.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="970">Okay, yeah, I'll agree with you on that one, but still...!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="971">But never mind that! We bought lots of yummy snacks,
so can we have tea now? Pretty pleeease?
With sugar on top?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="972">Sheesh. Next time, stick around and help, okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="973">You got it, Big Bro!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="974">Yeah... Good point.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I mean, I never would've finished this up so quickly
without you there helping me, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="975">Yeah... Good point.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I mean, I never would've finished this up so quickly
without you there helping me, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="976">Thanks for your help. I know you're a busy gal, and I just
ate up a whole bunch of your time. Sorry about that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="977">Thanks for your help. I know you're a busy guy, and I just
ate up a whole bunch of your time. Sorry about that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="978">I can handle the rest of the cleanup by myself.
See you later.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="979">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;. Mind if I come in?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="980">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;. Mind if I come in?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="981">Sorry to drop in on you like this, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I figured you would be finishing up your chores right
about now. Do you have some free time?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's an awfully nice day, so if you're up for it, why don't
we go out somewhere together?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

It's an awfully nice day, so if you're up for it, why don't
we go out somewhere together?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="983">Great! Man, I was actually a little worried about what
I was going to do if you were too busy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="984">Okay, then! Let's head out, &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="985">Okay, then! Let's head out, &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="986">This is a pretty scenic spot, don't you think? Let's rest
a bit here. Oh, and I brought a packed lunch for us, too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="987">This is a pretty scenic spot, don't you think? Let's rest
a bit here. Oh, and I brought a packed lunch for us, too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="988">Phew... This fresh forest air is chock-full of negative ions.
It sure feels good to breathe it in.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="989">I DO like caring for our chickens, but taking care of living
creatures is a big responsibility I have to take seriously.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You'd be surprised at how hard it is to relax when you're
running a store, too. I really need days off like this.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="990">That's why I wanted to spend some time just hanging out
with you, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But I also wanted to, y'know, thank you for being so good
to Mom and Popuri. And for helping at the store that one
time.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="992">Forgive me for bringing up a heavy subject, but my dad
just...left us one day, you know. Still hasn't come home.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You've seen how frail my Mom is, and Popuri is still so
young.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I've been pushing myself for their sake. To step up and
take care of not just the store, but my family, too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="993">That gets pretty stressful, y'know? I'm aware that I'm
grumpy and frazzled a lot. I just don't have time to relax.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="994">But seeing you getting along with Mom and Popuri like
you do, and having you come help at the store...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="995">But seeing you getting along with Mom and Popuri like
you do, and having you come help at the store...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="996">It feels so good to have you there for me. I feel like I have
help. Like I'm not trying to do this all alone.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="997">It feels so good to have you there for me. I feel like I have
help. Like I'm not trying to do this all alone.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="998">You can lean on me more.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="999">Let's both keep at it.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1000">Um, y-yeah. Right. You really are super dependable,
&lt;playername&gt;. I'm glad to have a girl like you in my
corner.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1001">Um, y-yeah. Right. You really are super dependable,
&lt;playername&gt;. I'm glad to have a guy like you in my
corner.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1002">But...I don't want to lean on you TOO much.
If I do, I feel like I'll be nothing but a mooch...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1003">Though if things get really hectic and I know I can't
handle it all myself, I'll definitely ask for your help.
Promise.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1004">Yeah. Thanks, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1005">Yeah. Thanks, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1006">I'm supposed to be the man of the house, but here I am
getting bailed out by you all the time, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Someday, I want to be capable enough to support you the
way you support me now. To be the man of YOUR house.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1007">I'm supposed to be the man of the house, but here I am

you support me. To be the man of YOUR house. Well, one
of 'em.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1008">As long as I have you, I think...no, I KNOW that I'll be able
to overcome any obstacle in my way.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1009">Anyway, it's getting late. Let's head back. I'll walk you to
your farm.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1010">Anyway, it's getting late. Let's head back. Last one to
your farm is a rotten egg!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1011">Thanks a lot for hanging out with me today,
&lt;playername&gt;. I appreciate it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1012">Thanks a lot for hanging out with me today,
&lt;playername&gt;. I appreciate it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1013">Time sure flies when you're having fun. We'll have to do
something like this again sometime.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1014">Time sure flies when you're having fun. We'll have to do
something like this again sometime.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1015">Phew! Man, talk about a panic attack! I swear I felt my
brain oozing outta my ears for a sec there.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1016">Ah. Yeah. Right. You bet your butt I know what that
means. You want us to be boyfriend and girlfriend, right?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Hooooo boy, you have NO idea how happy that makes me,
&lt;playername&gt;! I'm sweatin' bullets here!
Happy bullets!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1017">Ah. Yeah. Right. You bet your butt I know what that
means. You want us to be boyfriends, right?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Hooooo boy, you have NO idea how happy that makes me,
&lt;playername&gt;! I'm sweatin' bullets here!
Happy bullets!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1018">Duh. Of course my answer's yes. As of this moment,
I'm the pineapple to your...uh...pineapple tree! 'Kay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1019">Duh. Of course the answer's yes. As of this moment,
we're a pair of GUY-napples growin' on the tree of love!
'Kay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1020">Hahaha! Okay, so that was cheesy.
But I'm stoked for our future together, even if things
don't change much.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1021">Anyway, I'd better get back to work.
See ya soon!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1022">Yo, &lt;playername&gt;! Welcome!
Come to grab a bite to eat?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1023">Hm? Y'say that if I've got time for a break, you wanna go
fishing together?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1024">Haha! Sure thing! The Cafe was just winding down
anyway. Plus, I'm in the mood to get some exercise.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1025">But y'know? While we're at it, why don't we REALLY
stretch our legs and head for the lake to fish there
instead?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm only here in summer, and I don't usually wander far
from the beach. I wanna do some exploring with you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1026">Great! Plan made. Let's blow this popsicle stand.
...Hey, actually, should I add popsicles to the Cafe menu?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1027">Huh? Is that a chicken over there? What's one doing loose
out here?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1028">Hm? &lt;playername&gt;, what's wrong?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1029">No way! That's one of YOUR chickens?!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1030">Oops! Crap. I've always been bad at keepin' my volume
down. I startled it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1031">Hm? You're gonna go after it, and you want me to go
wait at the Cafe while you do? Uh, how 'bout nah?
Lemme help too!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1032">Though thinking about it, having a total chicken-handling
newbie tagging along would be more hindrance than help,
huh?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1033">Okay then, &lt;playername&gt;. Don't you worry about me.
Go on and catch your chicken. Break an egg. Er, a leg.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1034">Aha! You're back. How'd it go?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1035">From the look of it, I'm gonna assume that everything
turned out just fine.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1036">Hm? Sorry for spoilin' our fishing trip? Naaah, don't
worry about it. We'll just go some other time.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1037">Still, THAT was a shocker! Who woulda thought we'd
trip over one of your chickens? THERE, of all places?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1038">Hahaha! Lemme guess: you've worked up an appetite?
Good thing I thought to fix something up for you ahead
of time.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1039">See, I figured you'd come back tired and hungry from the
ol' chicken chase, so I threw together a little something.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1040">Ooh! Make dessert, too!</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1041">I bow to thee, saint of sustenance!</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1042">Ooh! Free refills too, right?</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1043">I bow to thee, saint of sustenance!</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1044">Whoa, whoa. You expecting me to put together
a full-course meal for you? Eesh. Ah, well.
For you, I guess I can.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1045">Whoa, whoa! Just how hungry are you? Eesh.
Ah well. For you, I guess so.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1046">Well, you DID work hard, so you deserve a little treat.
Heck, y'know what? I'll even make dessert for you, too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1047">Well, you DID work hard, so you deserve a little treat.
Heck, y'know what? I'll even make dessert for you, too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1048">Seeing you so happy about my food makes the work I put
into it more than worth it.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Hang on just a sec, &lt;playername&gt;.
I'll whip up that dessert for ya!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1049">Man, watching you chow down like that makes the work
I put into it more than worth it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1050">Y'know, now that I think about it, farm work has to be
pretty rough.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Here at my Cafe, I'll sometimes get a fussy customer who
complains over every little thing...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And just getting them calmed down and out the door is
headache enough. But at least I can talk to them.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Animals, on the other hand, can't talk. Getting THEM to
understand has to be way harder than even my crankiest
customer.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
That you can handle all of them every day, all by yourself,
is...honestly pretty amazing, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1051">Anyway, enough of that. The food's not goin' anywhere,
so feel free to pig out for as long as you like.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1052">...And that about sums it up.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1053">Huh. I getcha. Man, there really ARE all kinds of 'em,
huh?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1054">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;. Welcome, dearie.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1055">Yo, &lt;playername&gt;! Come to check out some seeds and
get a new crop goin'?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1056">Ah. Pourin' your blood, sweat, and tears into the farm as
always, eh?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1057">Hm? What, you think it's weird to find me here at the
General Store?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1058">Hm? What, you think it's weird to find me here at the
General Store?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1059">Haha! Yeah, you WOULD wonder about
that, wouldn'tcha?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1060">Haha! Yeah, you WOULD wonder about
that, wouldn'tcha?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1061">You aren't the only one, dearie. We're just as surprised
to see Kai as you are.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1062">You hardly ever drop by, dear--only in those rare
instances you happen to run out of something at your
Cafe, right?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And you always wait until our quietest hours to come in,
so our other customers barely ever see you here.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Not only that, but you came today with a question about
THAT, of all things...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1063">You said it, dear. To think that Kai, of all people,
would come here asking THAT. Surprised us both,
that's for sure.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1064">Ack! Whoa! Hold it, Jeff! Slow your roll, Sasha! I told you
that was all theoretical!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1065">A-Anyway! &lt;playername&gt;, you're here to do some
shopping, right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1066">I'm sure you're busy as heck with all your farm work and
stuff, so don't mind me! Go on and get what you need.
'Kay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1067">I, uh... I'd better get back to the Cafe. The food ain't
gonna cook itself, y'know! See ya!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1068">Ah-- And there goes &lt;playername&gt;, too. What in the
world was that all about? Kai looked positively panicked.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1069">Ah-- And there goes &lt;playername&gt;, too. What in the
world was that all about? Kai looked positively panicked.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1070">Come now, dear. Can't you put two and two together?
From what Kai asked and how he reacted, it was obvious
to me.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Hee hee. ∀ It's all for &lt;playername&gt;'s sake, isn't it?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1071">Whoa, whoa. &lt;playername&gt;, did you really chase me
all the way here? Don't you have work you should be
doing?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1072">No...I know. You followed me because you were worried
about me, right? Thanks. That makes me feel better.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1073">So, uh...yeah. &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1074">Back at the General Store, I was asking them about
what kinda stuff I'd need if I, y'know...stayed here
year-round.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I asked what the weather's like, what kinda events
the town holds... That sorta thing.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1075">This is all only hypothetical, though!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1076">We could be together! FOREVER.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1077">You really like this town, huh?</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1078">We could be together! FOREVER.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1079">You really like this town, huh?</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1080">Hahaha! Wow, what's up with that reaction, huh?
You really THAT happy to have a goof like me around
all the time?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1082">Hey, whoa! Quit it, man! You're makin' me blush.
Seriously, are you really THAT happy to have me
around all the time?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1083">See, I've been thinking about the future and if I wanna
keep living the way I've been, or if I wanna change
things up.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Watching you work so hard on your farm...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And seeing you go from exhausted to grinning after
one bite of my food... It all got me thinking, y'know?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1085">I had to wonder if I was around more, maybe I could
be a bigger help to you, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1086">I REALLY hate the cold, y'know? I go outta my way to
avoid it, following warm weather wherever it goes
year-round.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But now I'm thinking of staying here. It'd be a pretty
big change, y'know? And it's kinda embarrassing
to talk about.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1087">Heck, when I brought it up to Jeff and Sasha, their eyes
practically popped right outta their heads.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Then YOU strolled in, and all of a sudden, I got cold feet.
Ah, no pun intended. But that's why I took off.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1088">Ugh. I must've looked like a total dingus back there.
I hope I didn't freak Jeff and Sasha out at all.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1089">Man, now that I think about it, I bet I worried them just
as badly as I worried you, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1090">Once I've come back down to earth and have my head on
straight, I'll go back and explain everything to them.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

and watch the ocean with me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1092">In the meantime, would you, um...hang out here a bit longer

  <Entry Index="1093">Ah...ha ha...yeah. Right. This town is a nice place, and the
people are really friendly. Anybody'd want to live here.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Though...yeah. This is still all just hypothetical on my part,
'kay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1094">I don't wanna confuse folk into thinking I'm staying when
I haven't decided yet. That's why I ran earlier. I panicked.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But y'know? I'm just not used to other seasons. Living
through them sounds rough. Maybe it's not for me.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Yeah, actually...can we forget I ever brought it up,
&lt;playername&gt;? Just... pretend that it never happened.
Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1095">I'll have to ask Jeff and Sasha to do the same later, too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1239">Haha... I did it.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's not like I repaired it just to have Grandpa praise me,
but...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I've gotta admit it's a nice bonus.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1240">But...what IS it that I lack?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1241">Confidence?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I mean, it's true that I'm not always confident in my skills.
I beat myself up about it a lot.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Hmmm...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Maybe that timid attitude is exactly why I was missing
opportunities to grow.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1242">Thanks, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Since we started dating, I feel like the fog clouding my
eyes has started to clear. Dramatic, I know, but...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Maybe this is my moment to shine. Just you watch.
I'll become a full-fledged blacksmith before you
know it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1244">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Got a spare minute or three?
I was wondering if we could go out to eat together.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1246">Cool. Then let's go.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1247">So, yesterday...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1248">Hey, Ran.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Do you think Gray's been smiling more often recently?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1249">Huh? Has he?
I haven't really noticed.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1250">He definitely has.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Well, honestly, he hardly EVER smiled before. As long as
I've known him, he's had resting scowl face.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But now look at him.
He's grinning from ear to ear.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1251">Uh, I guess now that you mention it, you might be right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1252">Anyway, Dad, you need to hurry up and bring them
their drinks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1253">Oops, that's right.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1254">Here are your drinks. Enjoy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1255">Oh, thank you.
Put them right there, please.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1256">Gray...
You've changed.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1257">Have I?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1258">Yeah. You look a lot happier than you did before.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Before, you were more...
How should I put it?
You were always flaring up at Saibara.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And you had an air of inexperience about you,
like you were fumbling around and couldn't
figure out how to improve.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But now, you practically radiate self-assurance.
It's inspiring, really.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You've grown so much in such a short amount of time.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1259">C'mon, did I really seem THAT incompetent?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1260">Haha! Sorry.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It wasn't my intention to insult you. I was only trying to
say that you've grown into a fine man.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Here, drinks are on the house today. Please accept them
as an apology for my slip of the tongue.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1261">Hmmm... Have I changed that much?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1262">Huh, you think so? Well, if you say so, who am I to argue?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Maybe I HAVE grown.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1263">Maturity looks good on you.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1264">You have much yet to learn, grasshopper.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1265">You don't say?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's true that before I started dating you, all I cared
about was getting Grandpa's approval.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Looking back now, it's clear that I had my head
in the clouds.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Once I felt like I had a firm goal...
Once I committed to being good enough to stand
by your side...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...I had so much motivation that it was practically comin'
out my ears.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1271">I imagine we should be free from prying eyes and ears
here.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Now, let us continue our previous discussion.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1272">So, you weren't joking after all.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You want to be my girlfriend, hm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1273">So, you weren't joking after all.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You want to be my boyfriend, hm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1274">Yes, that's fine. In fact, I can think of no other person
I would rather become better acquainted with.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I feel like you and I could have a very special relationship,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1275">Allow me to pencil that into your chart, and...there.
Diagnosis: officially dating... Sorry, physician's humor.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'll be heading back, then. I have something I need to do.
See you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1276">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I realize this is a bit sudden, but would you come
to my home?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1277">Oh, there's nothing amiss. Carter simply heaped some wild
herbs and mushrooms on me, so...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...I thought I'd take the opportunity to make some
medicinal herb coffee. Hmm? Most people would just
say "tea"?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1278">Don't worry.
I've already tested it this time.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It turned out amazingly well, so I wanted to share some
with you after everything you've imbibed on my behalf.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Will you come?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1279">Excellent. Let's be off, then.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1280">Hello, &lt;playername&gt;.
I hope I am not intruding.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1281">Hello, &lt;playername&gt;.
I hope I am not intruding.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1282">Right, I'll get straight to the kitchen and make a cup for
you as well, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Please, have a seat. It should only take a moment.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1283">&lt;playername&gt;...
You seem a bit dubious yet.
Well, that's only natural.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Doctor has...encouraged...me to sample his medicines as
well, so I understand how you feel.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But this time, he really has succeeded in concocting
something remarkable. I didn't even taste the mushrooms
in it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1285">Sorry to keep you waiting.
Here you are. Drink up.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1286">It's good, you say? Well, of course it is! I wouldn't have
prescribed you yet ANOTHER harrowing taste test!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1287">Hm? You'd have no trouble drinking this on a daily basis,
even? A-Ah, well, funny you should say that...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I...may have failed to make note of the recipe I used.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I didn't adjust the flavor at all, and yet for some reason,
it turned out delicious.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1288">In other words...this is a product of pure happenstance.
Hardly scientific, I know.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Whether or not I'll be able to recreate today's success
depends on the herbs Carter brings.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1289">Don't be dependent on others.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1290">Write down the recipe next time.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1291">Y-You may as well take a scalpel and cut me to the bone
next time, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
For your information, I made the coffee all by myself.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1292">Y-Yes, you're absolutely right.
Sorry... Ha ha ha...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1293">Ha ha ha...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1294">You and Doctor make a wonderful couple,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm glad he's found a good partner.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
He can be a tad eccentric sometimes, after all.
No ordinary woman could keep him in check.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1296">Not you too, Carter. What is it about me that inspires
this sort of snark...?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1297">Well, for one thing, normal people don't force someone
they just met to take medicine that's still under
development.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1298">H-How did you know I...?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1299">Haha, I wonder...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1300">Well...I certainly admit that may not have been the most
ethical thing to do.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1301">That really was exceptionally rude of me,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1302">Hm? I only did it because I'm so passionate about my
research, you say?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1303">Hearing you say that is a relief.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
That helps me regain confidence that the choices I've
made have not all been complete mistakes.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Thank you, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1304">Each of us are preordained to meet the person who best

  <Entry Index="1305">Yes... I honestly believe that.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
With your aid, I will continue working to revolutionize the
world of medicine.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1306">My, my. That is certainly a fine and lofty goal, but...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1307">...Perhaps you could first focus on learning to write down
recipes?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1308">Y-Yes, you don't have to tell me twice...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1309">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I was thinking about going for a stroll to get my mind off
of work for a little while.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Would you care to join me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1310">All right, then. Let's be off.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1311">Oh ho, it's Doctor and &lt;playername&gt;.
Hello there.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1312">Hello, Mugi.
You've been doing well, I trust?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1313">Of course.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
These old bones feel sturdier than ever, no doubt thanks
to you leaping to my aid back when I needed it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1314">That's good to hear.
But please do be careful.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1315">Even if it was only a simple sprain of the wrist, failing to
exercise caution during the healing process will only--&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1316">Yes, Doctor, I'll be careful.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Oh, by the way. You're welcome to this milk from my
ranch, if you'd like.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I was just headed to the Clinic to give it to you as thanks
for your care.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1317">Well, now...
That's very considerate. Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1318">Not a worry, Doctor.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Well, if you'll excuse me...
Have a good time with &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1319">Thomas. Hello.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1320">Well, if it isn't Doctor and &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1321">Oh, by the way, Doctor...
I just stopped by Lillia's place.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It seems the new medicine you prescribed is very
effective. She's delighted with it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1322">Is that so?
Well, that's great to hear.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1323">Lillia wanted to thank you as well, so maybe you could
stop by her place when your schedule opens up, hm?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
She's grateful for the medicine, but also very happy that
you were more talkative during your last house call.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1324">She...said that, did she?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1325">That she did.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Incidentally, Ellen was saying the same thing: that your
visits tend to run longer than they used to.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
As Mayor, I can't tell you how much that pleases me.
I hope you'll continue taking good care of the
townspeople.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1326">It may come as a surprise to you, but this sort of thing is
a recent development.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Previously, no one would stop to chat with me when I was
out and about unless it was a medical emergency.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1327">I believe I said as much before, yes? That I've been told
I have this...intimidating air about me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1328">Since then, I have been wracking my brain to find
a solution.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
One change I've made is making idle conversation when
I meet with patients who have come for a checkup.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Ever since we started dating, I've tried to reflect on
your good habits and mimic them where applicable.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

Ever since we started dating, I've tried to reflect on

  <Entry Index="1330">You slide into conversation with anyone and everyone like
it's a matter of course, you see.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And you give gifts to the townspeople to establish
good relations.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
That's why I'm trying to learn from your example.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1331">And now, when the townspeople see me on the road,
they've started to talk to me.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I never paid it any mind before, but...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...opening your heart to others is an unexpectedly fulfilling
experience.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1332">Don't be a copycat.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1333">Your hard work paid off.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1334">Oh... I apologize. Should I have gotten your permission
first?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1335">Yes. That presence of mind might have been exactly what
I was lacking--not just as a physician, but as a man.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Actively seeking out others to cultivate relationships...
It may come naturally to you, but not to me.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I deeply respect that aspect of you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1336">&lt;playername&gt;, I'm sure there are yet many ways in
which I am ignorant of other people's feelings.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It may be an inconvenience to you, but...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...I would be grateful if you would point out when
I'm behaving in such a manner.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1337">Yes. I'll be counting on you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1338">Hn? And you are?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1339">Ah, I know. You're that new farmer who just moved in,
ain'tcha? Thomas told us all about you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Name's Gotts. I'm the carpenter around here. If you're
ever lookin' to renovate your house, come see me.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Farm work ain't a walk in the park, I'm sure. Good luck
and try not to throw your back out, eh?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1340">Yo, &lt;playername&gt;. Good to see ya.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1341">Oh yeah. &lt;playername&gt;, while you're here, lemme
introduce the guy I'm sharin' a roof with.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Yo, Brandon!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1342">What is it, Gotts? Inspiration presently beckons, and my
hands are heeding the call...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1343">This here's &lt;playername&gt;, who just moved into town.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
&lt;playername&gt;, this is Brandon.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1344">Aah. It's you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1345">What, you two know each other already?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1346">In a manner of speaking...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1347">Great! That makes this easier.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1348">See, Brandon's an artist. He does all kinda artsy stuff,
like carving and sculpting and what-have-you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Found him out cold in the woods. Spent so long lookin'
for good lumber to work with that he keeled right over,
he said.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I couldn't turn my back on a poor sap like that,
so now I'm lettin' him freeload here with me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1349">"Freeload"? Please. You could at least say I am simply
rooming with you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Anyway, &lt;playername&gt;, the pleasure is all mine.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1350">Ah, to heck with it. He's quiet and a little weird, but he
ain't a bad guy. Do me a favor and treat him right,
wouldja?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1351">...Hm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1352">Ah. &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I am busy at the moment. If you have no business with me,
come back la--&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1353">No. I take that back.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
&lt;playername&gt;, I have a question for you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1354">Avant-garde. Sinful. Free. What image do those three
words conjure in your mind?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1355">...No, no. Never mind. Forget I asked.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1356">I received a commission for a piece featuring those
themes, but I am having trouble finding the proper
inspiration.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I was hoping that an outside perspective might serve to
kindle my creative embers; thus, I asked you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But it is ultimately my problem, not yours. If nothing
comes to mind, that is fine.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1357">Maybe...something feline?</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1358">Maybe...something with chains?</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1359">Something...feline? Quite an intriguing angle you've taken.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1360">Yet... It is a strangely compelling answer. Hrm.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1361">Hm...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I can see how that would evoke the theme of sinfulness,
but not...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
No. Wait. I suppose I CAN see how it could be connected
with the theme of freedom.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1362">Cats and chains...
Breaking free...
Hrm. I see, I see.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1363">Aha. Inspiration strikes. I have found a path,
and now I have but to tread it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1364">...I can see I've confused you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1365">For inspiration to strike, one first needs a spark.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Communing with nature. Eating a meal. Speaking with
others.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The spark can come from anywhere, but it is more likely
to appear when doing something out of the ordinary.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
That is why I chose to speak with you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I have a distaste for meaningless chatter, but I am not
foolish enough to consider ALL conversation meaningless.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1366">Put simply: the time I spent speaking with you had both
meaning and purpose.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Thanks to that, I believe I can create a worthwhile piece.
You have my gratitude.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1367">Now, then, I must allow inspiration to make this idea
manifest. Please do not disturb me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1368">Ah. &lt;playername&gt;. What is it?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1369">Aah, so this piece caught your eye, did it?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Its theme is "thoughts from beyond the infinite cosmos."
It remains a work in progress.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1370">One evening, I happened to dream that I was floating,
weightless, within the inky blackness of space.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I decided to put the inspiration from that dream into
physical form, and this is the result of my work so far.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1371">Hrm? Being able to take one's dreams and give them
form is amazing, you say? Oh, no. It is nothing special
at all.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
To me, anyone who CAN'T give form to their imagination
simply hasn't tried hard enough yet.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If one wishes to create, even if they have yet to solidify
their inspiration into a concrete image...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...they must at least have a vague notion of what that
image might be, no?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Take that vague notion, work at it with enough diligence
and patience, and eventually, it will take shape.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It is not a matter of innate talent.
It is a matter of getting used to the process. That's all.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1372">Personally, I cannot understand those undisciplined souls
who give up before their efforts come to fruition.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
How can they leave that beautiful spark of inspiration
buried within them? How can they not give it form
and life?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1373">Everyone has their own inner universe that belongs to
them and them alone.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If everyone could tap into that universe and give it
form--SHARE it--then our world would be all the richer.
THAT is art.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1374">Do you want to take a closer look at this piece?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1375">Do as you please. I am going to brew myself some coffee.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1376">Erm...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You seemed to be enjoying yourself examining that piece,
so I got a little curious about what it made you feel.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1377">Enchanting! Beautiful! Now THIS is art!</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1378">I'm more interested in the artist.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1379">I see. It is always pleasant to be on the receiving end of
praise for one's work.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1380">I assume that means you want to know more about my
creative process?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1381">...You're interested in ME, hm? Your curiosity is piqued by
the most dull and meaningless things.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Unless you look at me through the lens of my art, I am
nothing but a dull human, devoid of any nuance or merit.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It is my art that makes me who I am.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1382">You know, it is difficult to tell at first glance, but you are
actually quite the eccentric yourself.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1383">If you weren't, why else would you be conversing with me
for this long?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1384">Most people exchange a few words with me and then
promptly take their leave.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I do not mean to be unkind, but I am aware that I tend
to be...blunt in my speech.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1385">Not that I am particularly concerned about it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1386">Hm. Ah, I know. About that piece you looked at earlier...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I have a miniature model version of it here.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1387">It is yours, if you wish. I have named it "The Looming
Nightmare: Insomnia."&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1388">Come again sometime.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I wouldn't mind continuing to hear your impressions
of my work.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1389">Yo, &lt;playername&gt;. Lookin' for Brandon?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1390">Sorry, but now probably ain't the time.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1391">See, he's goin' at his work like a man possessed right now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1392">Forgets to eat. Forgets to sleep. And--as you probably
saw--he forgets to clean up after himself.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1393">Ah, well. I hafta head out to work, so when he finally
comes up for air, could you give him a message?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Tell him to tidy up for me, wouldja?
Thanks. Welp, I'm off. Later.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1394">&lt;playername&gt;. I didn't know you were here.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm afraid I am busy at the moment. Unless you are here
on critical business, come back later.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1395">Gotts says "get tidying, buster."</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1396">Want me to clean up for you?</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1397">Gotts wants me to clean up the mess?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1398">Hrm. Yes, this room has taken on a rather disorderly air,
I suppose.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But I cannot afford to be distracted now. I must return
to my work.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1399">I promise I will clean once I reach a suitable stopping
point. See you later.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1400">Hm? You are offering to clean for me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1401">But...erm...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
All right. I hate to ask you to dirty your hands--literally--
but if you wouldn't mind...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1402">What? But I couldn't...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Though... I do cause enough bother for Gotts as it is.
I ought not cause more.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Well, then if you wouldn't mind, could I ask
for your assistance?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1403">Phew...There. Complete at last.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1404">Aah. &lt;playername&gt;. I just finished.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1405">Hrm. This room is so clean, I almost failed to recognize it.
Thank you. Your help is appreciated.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1406">...This always happens when I get caught up in my work.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Without your help, I would undoubtedly have been
subjected to Gotts rebuking me yet again upon his return.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1407">I'm back.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1408">Whoa! This place is so clean, I could eat dinner off the
dang floor! Not that I'm gonna.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I knew asking you to pass the message along was the
right idea, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1409">See, when Brandon gets absorbed in his work, he doesn't
hear a word I say, even if I shout till I'm blue in the face.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But you, &lt;playername&gt;? I figured he just might
hear ya. That's why I asked.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1410">Come to think of it, I don't recall ever conversing much
with others while I'm in the midst of my work.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1411">You're just not hearin' it. I try to talk to you every single
time, remindin' you to, y'know, maybe EAT and SLEEP.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1412">Really? Fascinating. I don't recall hearing so much
as a word to that end.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1413">*sigh* That's just the kinda guy you are, I guess.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1414">...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
What? You started this conversation.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I will wait. Organize your thoughts and start from
the beginning.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1415">Ah. I believe I'm beginning to grasp the outline of what
you are saying.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Essentially, you wish for the two of us to take our
relationship to a romantic level.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1416">Hrm. With you by my side, I can see my art ascending
to entirely new heights.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
All right. I accept. As of now, you are my girlfriend,
and I am your boyfriend.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1417">Ah. I believe I'm beginning to grasp the outline of what
you are saying.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Essentially, you wish for the two of us to take our
relationship to a romantic level.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1418">Hrm. With you by my side, I can see my art ascending
to entirely new heights.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
All right. I accept. As of now, you are my boyfriend,
and I am yours.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1419">I look forward to exploring this relationship with you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Now then, I must go. My work awaits me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1420">&lt;playername&gt;...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1421">Er, no. It is not anything particularly important.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's just... Now that we are dating, it occurs to me that
I know next to nothing about YOUR work.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
So I thought I ought to come watch you and learn what
you do firsthand.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1422">Er, no. It is not anything particularly important.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's just... Now that we are dating, it occurs to me that
I know next to nothing about YOUR work.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
So I thought I ought to come watch you and learn what
you do firsthand.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1423">Hrm. This is actually a rather sizable farm.
And you manage it all yourself?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1424">You maintain this house on your own as well, I assume...
Hm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1425">There is a crack here.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Leave it be, and before long, you will be contending with
a most fearsome draft.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1426">It would probably be prudent to leave the repairs to
Gotts, but...ah well.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Lend me a hammer. I will fix it for you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1427">There. That ought to do it for this spot.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1428">Hm? You're surprised I was able to repair it?
Well, of course I have the skill.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I am freeloa--ahem. I am RESIDING with Gotts,
a capable carpenter.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I do occasionally assist him with repairs and the like.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1429">You know what? I may as well finish the job.
Let me inspect everything and fix whatever
seems to be in disrepair.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If you would assist me, please?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1430">Phew... That ought to do it.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I've actually worked up quite a sweat.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1431">Talk about a deft hand! Thanks!</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1432">So you really CAN help others.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1433">Don't worry about it.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You have helped me many a time. It is only proper
that I return the favor.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Besides...I can infer much about you just by looking
at your farm.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You take your farm work seriously, selflessly giving
it your all day in and day out.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1434">Seeing that, I just...felt like doing something to help.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1435">Did you not hear what I said?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I told you that I will, on occasion, help Gotts with his
carpentry work.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If repairing someone else's home does not fall under
"helping others," I do not know what you would call it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1436">Ah, well. I simply felt like helping you on a whim. Besides,
it was not entirely fruitless for me, either.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1437">Looking at your farm has fanned the flames
of my imagination.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
A domicile resplendent with the warm glow of life
and joy... I now have a clear idea of what constitutes
a "farm."&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1438">Now then, I must be off. This inspiration needs to be given
form as quickly as possible.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Until next time.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1439">I've eaten so much, and yet it's STILL not enough.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1440">Uh, Brandon, I hate to say this, but... You keep this up and
I'm gonna have to roll ya to bed.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1441">My standard activity level is sufficient to burn the
calories I consume, so there is little worry of that
happening.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Besides, no matter how rotund I become, I will not cease
to be myself. Thus, I see no need to change my behavior.&lt;wait&gt;
</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1442">Yo, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1443">Lemme tell ya, these artist types are borderline
impossible to wrap your head around.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
He ain't listening to me, so YOU try tellin' him he's gotta
eat some real food before he makes himself sick.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Me? I've gotta head out to work. Besides, watching him
like this is gonna give me heartburn REAL fast.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1444">...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Ah. It is you. Yes? I am presently contending with a most
pernicious problem.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1445">You see...I am in a slump.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I woke up one morning, and suddenly I was devoid of
inspiration. Not so much as a single spark has visited
me since. &lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
When I am out of sorts like this, my habit is to eat
nothing but sweets until the condition passes.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1446">Yes. I am aware it is unhealthy. I assure you,
that particular lecture is one I have heard
time and again.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Yet I do not know of any other way to free myself
from a slump. Thus, I walk the only avenue I know
how to traverse.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Eating sweets has become a ritual of mine. After all,
the brain demands sugar after it has been used
extensively, no?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1447">Hrm. No, I am afraid I could not tell you when I last ate
a proper, nutritious meal.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1448">What? YOU will prepare something for me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1449">...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1450">All right. If you insist upon demonstrating your culinary
prowess to me, the least I can do is sample it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1451">Hmm. Now what do I want to make for him?</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1452">Something light with veggies.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1453">Something heavy and filling.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1454">Mm. A pleasant odor, that.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I can't say I enjoy many vegetables, but it is possible my
body's desire for vitamins is overruling my taste buds.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Besides, after gorging on sweets, this seems like a
pleasantly light cap to my dining experience.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1455">My stomach is already full of sugar, and now you want
me to supplement that with another heavy, filling meal?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1456">And yet...you DID make it for me.
Okay. I will eat it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1457">Thank you. I daresay that was quite delicious.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1458">Am I out of my slump now, you ask?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
No. Of course not. Slumps are not so easily shrugged off.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
They are, metaphorically speaking, like being in a tunnel
with no visible exit.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
All one can do is keep walking. When the exit will be
found, no one can say.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1459">However...I must admit, I am feeling delightfully relaxed
right now.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Perhaps I had stressed myself into that unfortunate
state without realizing it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1460">...When I create, I usually listen to the voices of
my materials, and sculpt them into the form they
have chosen.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
When I carve wood, I mind the voice of the lumber.
When I sculpt clay, I pay heed to the voice of the clay.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But when I fall into a slump, it is as if I have gone deaf.
The voices of my materials no longer reach me.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If I cannot hear their voices, I cannot create. That is why
slumps frighten me. In fact, little terrifies me more.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1461">Do you not understand what I am saying? I must seem
positively deranged to you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1462">Hm. Of course.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Therein lies the reason why I do not speak of this
to anyone else. They would only think me crazy.
They always have.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But in your case...I believed that even if you did not
comprehend, you would at least listen earnestly,
and not laugh.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
In fact...I think I WANT you to understand.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1463">It's strange.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I am still trapped in a slump, but for some reason, it is as
if my mind is clear. I feel refreshed, even.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1464">You are an odd person.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1465">It's strange.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I am still trapped in a slump, but for some reason, it is as
if my mind is clear. I feel refreshed, even.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You are an odd person.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1466">I think I'd like to interpret you via an art piece someday.
You would be smooth and flowing, with a sky-blue hue...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1467">Hm...? Wait. There it is. The sudden spark of inspiration!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1468">Aaah... It would seem I have come to the end of the tunnel
at long last.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Wait right there. Something tells me I will be able to
complete this piece quickly.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1469">It's finished!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1470">&lt;playername&gt;. This piece found its life because of
you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Accordingly, I think you should have it. I call it...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
"Life's Mystery and Milk: A Sculpture of Earth's Bounty
and the Chasm of Love."&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1471">There. Now that my work is complete, I have a little free
time. Why not stay for a bit?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1472">I find I've been struck by the urge to talk with you some
more. Will you humor me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1473">We should be able to have a quiet discussion here.
Now, please continue where you left off.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...Are you serious?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1474">Are you really, truly certain you want...me?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Do you honestly want a man like me at your side for the
rest of your life?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1475">I see. Then my answer goes without saying.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I do not indulge in romantic relations as a mere flight of
fancy. I take them seriously.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Since the moment I agreed to be your boyfriend, I have
envisioned this future.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1476">Allow me to accompany you along the path of life as it
winds through the remainder of our waking days.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1478">I must admit this does not yet feel real, but...I brim with
enthusiasm for our future together, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1479">Now, I'd best announce the good news. Gotts, at least,
deserves to know.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1480">Now, I'd best announce the good news. Gotts, at least,

That's wonderful! Congrats, Brandon! And you too,

  <Entry Index="1483">Now, you just leave all the setup for the ceremony and
everything to me.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'll ask Mayor Thomas to gimme a hand. I'm sure he'll help
me find a good spot and send out the invites for you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
With all that's gotta be done, I'd say it'll take about
a week to get it all ready to go.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

And...Gotts?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1486">Hm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1487">Thank you very much for all you've done to help me.
I would not be where I am today without you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1488">Oh, quit it.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's not as if two quiet guys like us are suddenly gonna
start chattin' up a storm.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You movin' out isn't gonna be any earth-shattering
change, so don't you worry yourself 'bout me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1489">...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1490">But, well...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'd be lyin' if I said I never looked at you and thought...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...that if my girl was still alive, she'd be about your age.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1491">Gotts, I...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1492">I'll leave your atelier just the way it is. Come on over and
use it whenever you please.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You two be happy now, hear?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1493">We will.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1494">Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to see
&lt;playername&gt; and Brandon joined in matrimony.
Let us begin.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1495">Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to see

  <Entry Index="1496">&lt;playername&gt;. Brandon. Do you both hereby swear
to take each other as your sole partner for the rest
of your lives...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...To have and to hold, to respect and to cherish,
your hearts united no matter what may come?
For now, and forever?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1497">Brandon, you'd better stay real sweet on
&lt;playername&gt; now, y'hear?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1498">Nothing quite like a good wedding to get the tears
flowing and the heart beating. Congrats to you both!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1499">Seeing two joyous souls joined as one fills MY heart with
positive energy too. I wish you both the best.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1500">&lt;playername&gt;. I realize that I am blunt, and that may
cause you grief in the future.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But I promise that I will treat you more tenderly than
anyone. I look forward to spending my life with you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1501">Finally, we are home. I am exhausted. But I will admit
that was a lovely ceremony.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Seeing your face aglow with happiness and pride was the
greatest gift I could have received.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
To think that from now on, we will both be living here...
Together. As a couple.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1502">Ah, yes. I gave it some thought, and...would it not be
interesting to give each other new nicknames?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I, of course, am happy with you calling me "Brandon," as
you always have. What do you want me to call you?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1503">&lt;nickname&gt;? I see. If you wish it so, then that is
what I will call you from now on.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1504">You want me to call you something else? Such as?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1505">Well then, &lt;nickname&gt;. Allow me to express once
more how much I look forward to spending my life
with you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1506">Oh...it's you, &lt;playername&gt;.
...Hello.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1507">Oh, it's you, &lt;playername&gt;.
...Hello.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1508">I appreciate the boost, &lt;playername&gt;.
Even if I still don't really understand what Grandpa's
trying to teach me.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But I'll keep working at it. I hafta trust that I'll get
it someday.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1509">Ah... Hey, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1510">&lt;playername&gt;...
Uh...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1511">There's something I'd like to talk to you about, if you've
got a sec.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Um... Sorry for yelling a while back.
I shouldn't have treated a customer like that.
I really regret it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1512">But I'd hate to know that you thought badly of me
because of one blow-up.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Hope you can accept my apology for all that mess.
We good?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1513">Oh, that reminds me! You ship ore and ore-adjacent stuff,
right, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1514">Once I've had a chance to hone my skills a bit, mind if I try
makin' something for you, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1515">It's not that big of a deal.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I've still got a long way to go, but I'm hoping I can leave
even Grandpa in the dust someday. In smithing, I mean.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Once I've had a chance to hone my skills a bit, I'll make
somethin' especially for you, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1516">Hello, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1517">There's something I'm biting at the bit to ask you today,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1518">There's a reason I came here today.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I wanted to give you this.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1519">I made that from scratch--all by myself--without
Grandpa knowing.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
He's still way better than me, but I'm at least
at the point in my training where I can make simple
stuff like this.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I figured that if it turned out well,
I'd give it to you, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1520">What, Grandpa?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Oh, &lt;playername&gt;. Welcome.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1521">Um... Hey. I guess this is a good enough time to ask.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Are you planning on staying in this town long-term,
&lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1522">Some people only stick around here for a certain amount
of time, like Kai. Kinda like a...reverse snowbird, y'know?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Others, like my old man, end up moving to another
town altogether.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
That's why I've been curious about what you're gonna do,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1523">Uh, I've been wondering... Should we change the names we
call each other?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You can call me whatever you want.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But what do YOU wanna be called, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1524">Take care, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1525">Hello, &lt;playername&gt;.
Are you working hard on your farm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1526">Oh, by the way, Doctor said he had something to give you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1527">&lt;playername&gt;, could you come here for a moment?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1528">Doctor's acting strangely. He seems to be lost in thought
and has a permanent scowl plastered on his face.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I tried talking to him, but he won't so much as
acknowledge me.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If you don't have any plans today, could you try speaking
with him?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1529">So are you visiting from Crazytown, or...?</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1530">You should be more careful.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1531">How many times have I heard something along those
lines? At this point, that sentiment is as water off a
duck's back.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1532">Now that's astounding. Are you legitimately concerned
for my well-being?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1533">I...will exercise more caution from here on out.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1534">Rick, sweetie. &lt;playername&gt;. I wish you two all the
best. I just know you'll build the loveliest little family.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1535">Now that we're married, should we, um, call each other
something different?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm fine with you continuing to call me "Cliff."&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But what should I call you, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1536">Oh, you both look so lovely! ♪ Goodness, I...I think I'm about
to cry.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
