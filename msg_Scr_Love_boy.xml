&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="10">Now there's a face I haven't seen before. Are you here
to do a little sightseeing?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="11">Ah. I'd heard someone had moved into that old farmhouse.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
So, your name is &lt;playername&gt;?
I'm Karen. It's a pleasure.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="12">Ah. I'd heard someone had moved into that old farmhouse.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
So, your name is &lt;playername&gt;?

Come to do a little shopping?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="15">All right, then. Please take your time.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="16">Finding what you need? If you're having trouble,
just let me know.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="17">You just started your farm, right? It's a headache trying
to figure out where even to begin, I'm sure.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="18">You'll need seeds for your crops and seeds for Fodder to
feed your animals, not to mention the tools to sow them...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="19">The list of things to buy and to do goes on and on.
You following so far?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="20">I, uh, could use some help...</Entry>
  <Entry Index="21">I've got this!</Entry>
  <Entry Index="22">Of course. I don't blame you.
Here, hang on just a second.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="23">Dad? I'm going to give &lt;playername&gt; some seeds.
Do you mind?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="24">Dad? I'm going to give &lt;playername&gt; some seeds.
Do you mind?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="25">What, really? You want to give away our merchandise,
just like that?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="26">Well, yes! Friends help friends! &lt;playername&gt; just
moved here, you know. It's only right that we help
as we can.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="27">Karen has a point, dear. How about you step up and show
how generous you can be for once, hmm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="28">W-Well, ah... When you put it that way... I guess I could
hand out a free sample or two.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="29">Thanks, Dad! ♪&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="30">Now there's that darling husband of mine.
I knew I married you for good reason.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="31">O-Oh, quit it, both of you.
You're making me blush.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="32">Here you go. They're on the house, so don't worry about
the tab.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="33">We hope to see you at our General Store again soon.
Good luck with your farm. We'll be rooting for you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="34">Oh? I guess you have a firmer grip on farming than
I thought. All right, then.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If there's anything I can do to help, let me know, okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="35">Raising crops, caring for livestock... It's a costly
profession, I'll say that much. Good luck out there.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="36">If you have any questions about seeds or farming tools,
you can ask my dad.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="37">Good luck with your farm, dear. Swing on by and see me
if you ever need advice or someone to vent to.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="38">Now, now, you two. Why don't you both take a deep
breath? If any customers saw you like this, they'd run
in terror.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="39">Oh, hush, you. This is between me and Karen.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="40">Um, but...er...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="41">Shush, Dad! What, don't tell me you're taking Mom's side
on this!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="42">Be still, my raging daughter. You don't have to be so
prickly about it-- Oooh, ow. Now my ulcer's acting up...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="43">Ow. Ow ow ow. My ulcer.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="44">Hm? Oh! It's you, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="45">&lt;playername&gt;. Welcome. All right, you two.
We have a customer. How about you
set that topic aside for a moment?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="46">No, I think this is our chance to get the opinion of an
impartial observer.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="47">Good point, Mom. &lt;playername&gt; is the perfect person
to ask. &lt;playername&gt;, do you have a minute?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="48">Hm? Oh! It's you, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="49">&lt;playername&gt;. Welcome. All right, you two.
We have a customer. How about you set that

  <Entry Index="50">Good point, Mom. &lt;playername&gt; is the perfect person
to ask. &lt;playername&gt;, do you have a minute?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="51">See, one of my relatives has a child who was just
admitted to the hospital.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="52">We both agreed it would be a sweet gesture to send over
some flower seeds as a get-well-soon gift.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="53">I think the OBVIOUS choice is to send Moondrop Flower
Seeds, but Mom is being stubborn about it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="54">Heavens no, child. Moondrop Flowers are completely out
of the question. Pink Cat Flower Seeds are the superior
option.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="55">So, yeah. They've both spent the day clashing over
something that really doesn't matter either way...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="56">This is where you come in, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="57">Yes. Let's settle it this way, shall we? Whichever one
&lt;playername&gt; picks is the one we send. No hard
feelings.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="58">Good grief...really? Ah well. If it means you'll finally stop
bickering, I guess it's fine.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="59">Good! Then let's go with that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="60">This is where you come in, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="61">Well, &lt;playername&gt;? The power is yours. Go on and
pick which flower seeds you think we should send.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="62">Well, &lt;playername&gt;? The power is yours. Go on and
pick which flower seeds you think we should send.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="63">Moondrop Flower Seeds</Entry>
  <Entry Index="64">Pink Cat Flower Seeds</Entry>
  <Entry Index="65">Aha! I knew you'd agree with me, &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="66">Sheesh. Neither of you have any taste. Well, fair's fair.
I suppose we'll send the seeds Karen picked, then.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="67">Right on! ♪
Thanks, &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="68">Aha! I knew you'd agree with me, &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="69">Right on! ♪
Thanks, &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="70">Seriously?! &lt;playername&gt;, you like Mom's choice
better than mine?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="71">Now, now. We agreed there would be no hard feelings.
The decision is made, so you'll have to suck it up, dear.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="72">Fine, fine. I was just disappointed, that's all.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I guess I'll get the seeds Mom picked ready to send.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="73">Seriously?! &lt;playername&gt;, you like Mom's choice
better than mine?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="74">Phew! I'm just glad they're done arguing.
Thanks, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="75">Phew! I'm just glad they're done arguing.
Thanks, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="76">Well...the argument is over, at least. But Karen can get
pretty scary when she's mad...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="77">I guess this means you and I have similar taste in flowers.
Somehow, that makes me kinda happy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="78">I guess this means you and I have similar taste in flowers.
Somehow, that makes me kinda happy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="79">Welp, I did make my bed with this, so I guess I have to lie
in it. No hard feelings.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="80">*sigh* I still think the seeds I picked are far better.
The minds of youngsters are puzzling indeed...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="81">My! To think you'd agree with my choice of seeds.
You have excellent taste.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="82">...And there you have it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="83">What, really?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="84">Woohoo! Nectar of the gods, incoming! I'm so excited!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="85">Mom. Dad. Thank you so much!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="86">Goodness, has it been that long already?
No wonder I feel old.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="87">Seeing Karen so happy about it makes me doubly glad we
decided to do it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="88">Ah. &lt;playername&gt;, welcome.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="89">Get a load of this! Mom and Dad had a batch of grape
wine made the year I was born!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I had no clue they'd kept a present like that secret for so
many years. I'm equal parts gobsmacked and elated!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="90">Mhm. Ol' Jeff comes up with some pretty clever ideas,
don'tcha think?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
That batch is just about ready for drinkin', so I thought
I'd come by and let you all know.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="91">Ah. &lt;playername&gt;, welcome.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="92">Well? You itchin' to go pick it up? Or you could let it sit
for a bit yet.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="93">I'm going to go and get it, of course. Now that I know
about it, how could I not want to drink it right away?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="94">Oh, I know! &lt;playername&gt;, why don't you go collect
that batch of grape wine with Karen?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="95">Dad, don't you think that's kinda rude? &lt;playername&gt;
is a busy person. You can't just impose on someone like
that.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Besides, it's just a quick wine run. I can manage that on
my own.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="96">Yes, I know, you're a big girl. I just don't want you getting
so excited that you drop it on your way home, okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="97">Ugh. I'm not THAT big of a klutz, Dad. If anyone would
trip and drop it on the way home, it'd be you. Still...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="98">Oh, I know! &lt;playername&gt;, why don't you go collect
that batch of grape wine with Karen?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

could be fun.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="101">Well, &lt;playername&gt;?
Are you primed for wine time?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="102">Going for a walk with &lt;playername&gt; sounds like it

  <Entry Index="103">Well, &lt;playername&gt;?
Are you primed for wine time?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="104">Let the wine flow.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="105">Sorry. I'm too busy.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="106">You'll come along?
That'd be a big help, for sure.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="107">C'mon. Let's do this. ♪&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="108">Here ya go.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="109">Ooh! Thanks so much, Uncle Duke! Look, it even has my
name on the label. I'll savor every sip, I promise!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="110">No problem. Seeing you so happy makes all the work
I put into it feel worth it, and then some.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="111">*giggle* Ooh, I wonder how it tastes. I can hardly wait to
bust it open!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="112">C'mon. Let's hurry home.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="113">Whoa, hold it. Where are you going?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="114">Hm? What do you mean? We picked up the wine, so we're
going home.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="115">Hold your horses. Nobody ever said I only made one bottle.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="116">What, there's more? I guess we could get a bag or two to
carry them in.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="117">Hah! If it were something one person could carry,
I would've delivered 'em to you myself!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But Jeff was so over the moon when you were born, he
came hollerin', "Duke, make me THREE CASES of grape
wine!"&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And three cases I made. Every bottle on that shelf is
part of the batch. Here, help me pack 'em up.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="118">So much for drinking in moderation... Sorry,
&lt;playername&gt;. I didn't think it would be this much.
Help me carry them?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="119">Talk about going overboard, Dad... How does he expect the
two of us to carry all this?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="120">I'm sorry, &lt;playername&gt;, but do you mind lending me
a hand?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="121">Ugh. I'm exhausted. Thanks for helping me carry them all.
There's no way I would've made it just by myself.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's good to know Mom and Dad were happy I was born,
but still. They didn't have to open their own personal
distillery...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="122">Though... I guess this stands as "proof" of just how much
they care for me. Heh.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="123">Wait, I know! Hang on a minute, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="124">Here. One bottle of my special grape wine.
Take it as thanks for your help today.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="125">I was really, really glad to have you along. Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="126">I was really, really glad to have you along. Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="127">Ah. If you're busy, then I won't twist your arm.
Karen, we can go pick it up together later.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="128">What, YOU want to come along, Dad? Ah well.
That works.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="129">I was hoping you could go along and help Karen pick up
the wine, but if you're busy, I won't twist your arm.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="130">Aah, the suspense is killing me! Is Dad's shift over yet?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="131">Seeing Karen so happy makes me happy, too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="132">So Jeff's gonna come and pick it up, eh? I...don't think he'll
be able to carry it all.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
He DOES remember he told me to make three cases of it
for him, right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="133">Now I just need to season for taste... Mm, maybe I should
add this? Oh, but this would also pair well with it...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="134">(Why? Why did this have to happen?)&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="135">(Shh! Keep your voice down, dear. Karen will hear you.)&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

an eye on things...)&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

a big smile and said she wanted to give back
to us for all we've done...)&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

  <Entry Index="138">(Urk. I-I see how it would be hard to say no to that.
But still...)&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="142">Thanks! Here, go ahead and taste it for me, would you?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="143">Wait...erm, you haven't tasted it yet, Karen?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="144">Nope! I want you two to get the very first taste.
It was hard to restrain myself, you know.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="145">(Um, dear? Now what? Karen looks awfully serious
about this.)&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

dog eyes...)&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="366">Listen to this, sweetie. Popuri and Rick are having a
nasty little argument over my husband.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
They won't listen to a word I say. Could you talk to them,
please? Maybe they will listen to you, if not to me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="367">But Mamaaa! Rick is being a total jerk!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Papa left so he could find a flower that might cure your
condition, and Rick is calling him irresponsible and stupid.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I think the fact that he left actually proves just how
much he cares. Calling him stupid for it is just plain mean!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="368">Look, I'm fine with the idea of doing something to try and
help Mom. Happy, even.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But he just took off after hearing one rumor! We don't
even know if that stupid flower really exists!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
THAT'S what's irresponsible! Right now, the most
important thing he could do is be here to support Mom!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="374">&lt;playername&gt;! Could you kindly NOT butt into our
private family business? It's rude.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="375">Just because &lt;playername&gt; agrees that you're
WRONG doesn't mean you get to be snippy, Rick!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="376">Ugh...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="377">&lt;playername&gt;! Could you kindly NOT butt into our

You don't get anything!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="389">Oh, good gracious... Now they're arguing over you instead
of my husband.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
How much longer will you two fight? Brothers and

For Mom?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="393">Phew. You finally stopped arguing. What a relief.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="394">Now, Popuri. Rick. Please stop arguing about your father.
It isn't his fault. All of this is my fault for being ill.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="395">No, Mama! You can't blame yourself!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="396">Yeah. You didn't do anything wrong, Mom. And, uh... Yeah.
I'm sorry I called Dad stupid.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="397">It's all right, sweetie. I know you're just concerned about
your family's well-being.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="398">This isn't any of your business. How can you pretend to
know anything?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="399">I'm glad you could see it my way. Sorry to drag you into

  <Entry Index="400">Sorry to drag you into our family business. I'll try not to

  <Entry Index="408">Okay, I don't think anyone will disturb us here. Boy, you
sure surprised me, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="409">So, um... Could you please say what you said again?
From the beginning?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Once I really take it in, I should be able to give you
a proper answer.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

careful not to overeat again.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="543">Yeah, okaaay. I'll be careful.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="544">*sigh* Things've finally settled down.
Dad gave me an earful.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="545">I should apologize to you too, &lt;playername&gt;,
for making such a scene.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="546">I should apologize to you too, &lt;playername&gt;,
for making such a scene.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="547">And...thanks. I was kinda touched.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You were so concerned about me that you even helped
take me to the Clinic.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="548">Oh, before I forget... Wait here a sec.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="549">And...thanks. I was kinda touched.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You were so concerned about me that you even helped
take me to the Clinic.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="550">It's broken, so it doesn't play music anymore, but it's one
of my most beloved treasures. Please take it,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="551">Th-There's no deep meaning behind it or anything.
It's just my way of saying thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="552">It's broken, so it doesn't play music anymore, but it's one
of my most beloved treasures. Please take it,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="553">Take care of it, okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="554">Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="555">Well, I'm gonna get back to work. See you,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="556">Well, I'm gonna get back to work. See you,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="557">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;. Welcome.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="558">Perfect timing. There's something I need to talk
to you about.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="559">It's about Ran. She's been through a lot, you know.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I raised her by myself after her mother died, which might
sound impressive to an outside observer, but...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
To be honest, I've only made it this far because she's so
levelheaded.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="560">I want her to find a good partner and be happy. To make
up for all the hardship she's endured, you know?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="561">But she's never once mentioned anything about love.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Except recently, you're all she talks about.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
With that being said, I've got a question for you. How do
YOU feel about Ran?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="562">She's found her way "inn" to my heart.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="563">Uh... We're friends?</Entry>
  <Entry Index="564">That so? Oh, that's a relief to hear!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="565">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;. Welcome!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="566">Ran, go stand next to &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="567">Uh, sure, but...why?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="568">Reason doesn't matter. Just do it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="569">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;. Welcome!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="570">Ahem. Ran, how do you feel about &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="571">Uh... What kinda question is that?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="572">I-It's none of your business!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="573">It most definitely IS my business. I have more than enough
reason to ask. You're my one and only daughter!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="574">Agh...!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="575">Ha ha ha ha ha! What're you so embarrassed for?
You're not a kid anymore!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="576">Hey, you're all red too!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Well, anyway...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="577">O-Oh, yeah? She's a good girl, if I do say so myself. Even if
I AM a bit biased. And you two seem to get along so well.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="578">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;. Welcome!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="579">H-Hey, Ran. Are you done cleaning the second floor?
You didn't just hear all that, did you?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="580">Yeah, I'm done. And hear all what? What were you
talking about?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="581">Oh, no, nothing, really. Aha ha ha...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="582">Sheesh, Dad! Quit roping &lt;playername&gt; into your
little schemes!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="583">Sheesh, Dad! Quit roping &lt;playername&gt; into your
little schemes!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="584">Who's scheming? You're my one and only daughter, aren't
you?! I can't pretend like you're not precious to me!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="585">Agh...!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="586">*sigh* Sorry, &lt;playername&gt;. My dad can be kinda
forceful sometimes.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="587">*sigh* Sorry, &lt;playername&gt;. My dad can be kinda
forceful sometimes.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="588">*sigh* Sorry, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I don't know what you were talking about, but if I know
my dad, I have an inkling...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="589">*sigh* Sorry, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I don't know what you were talking about, but if I know
my dad, I have an inkling...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="590">A while back, I started chatting with a guest who came
to the Inn, and Dad asked them how they felt about me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="591">He's so blunt. The guest was really taken aback and
stopped coming to the Inn.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="592">Talk about tactless.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="593">He's a good father.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="594">Ha ha, seriously. But I only chatted with that guest
because they had such interesting stories to tell.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="595">I know he's just worried about me, but he should let me
handle that stuff and just worry about himself.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="596">Once I've cooled off a bit, I'll go back to work. I'm gonna
rake him over the coals later, trust me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="597">Yeah. I know he's trying to love me enough for Mom's
sake, too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="598">But sometimes, he goes overboard, and I get SO fed up
with him. Like today.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="599">Well, I'll get back to work in a few. I'm gonna rake him
over the coals later, trust me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="600">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;. How was Ran?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Well, uh... No matter how you feel about Ran,
I'm glad she's got a friend like you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="601">I leave Ran to you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="602">What is it? You here for some food?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="603">No one's scheduled to come here today, right?
W-We can talk in private here, yeah?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="604">Back to what we were talking about earlier...
Um... C-Can I clear something up?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="605">&lt;playername&gt;...are you sure? Are you sure you're
all right with me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="606">&lt;playername&gt;...are you sure? Are you sure you're
all right with me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="607">Aaah! I'm happier than a freshly waxed floor!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="608">I've been dreaming of this day ever since we
started going out.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You've become so important to me, &lt;playername&gt;.
I get depressed on days when I don't see you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
So...to say I'm on cloud nine would be the
understatement of the century! ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="609">I've been dreaming of this day ever since we

  <Entry Index="610">I have to go tell Dad!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="611">I see! So you've decided to be with &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Of course you have my blessing, Ran!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="612">Thanks, Dad!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="613">I'm sure your mother in heaven also agrees that
&lt;playername&gt; is the only one who's right for you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="614">Yeah. I know that's what Mom would say if she
were here.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="615">In that case, we've gotta get ready for the wedding.
It's the first day of your new life, so a big party's in
order.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I've gotta get a move on. First I'll tell the mayor, then
contact the venue and townspeople, and what else...?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="617">Dad, you're busy with the Inn. You don't have to put so
much effort into our ceremony.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="618">Don't be ridiculous, Ran. This is for you and my new son.
I've gotta go all out.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The ceremony will be in about a week. Start getting
excited now!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="619">Don't be ridiculous, Ran. This is for you and my new
daughter. I've gotta go all out.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

  <Entry Index="620">Oh, Dad... Yeah, you're right. Well, I'll leave it to you, then.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="621">Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to see
&lt;playername&gt; and Ran joined in matrimony.
Let us begin.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="622">Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to see
&lt;playername&gt; and Ran joined in matrimony.
Let us begin.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="623">&lt;playername&gt;. Ran. Do you both hereby swear
to take each other as your sole partner for the rest
of your lives...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...To have and to hold, to respect and to cherish,
your hearts united no matter what may come?
For now, and forever?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="624">Ran! &lt;playername&gt;! Congratulations! May you build
a happy family together!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Your happiness is my happiness. Don't you ever
forget that!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="625">&lt;playername&gt;, now we'll be together forever.
I love you. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="626">&lt;playername&gt;, now we'll be together forever.
I love you. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="627">Phew, we're home! After the ceremony was pictures,
and then the reception party... It was all a blast!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Thanks to Dad and everyone's help, this day'll be one
to remember forever.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="628">It was wonderful to celebrate with everyone,
but now we're finally alone together.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

It was wonderful to celebrate with everyone,
but now we're finally alone together.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="630">Oh, that reminds me! I've been thinking...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Now that we're living together, it'd be nice to call each
other by our own special names.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="631">So, whaddaya think?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="632">Okay, I'll call you that!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="633">You want some other name, huh? What sounds good, then?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="634">You got it. I'll call you &lt;nickname&gt; from now on! ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="635">Oh, and I have another important thing I've gotta discuss
with you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I want to keep helping Dad at the Inn.
Would that be okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="636">Yeah, okay. Let's work together as partners!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="637">All right, &lt;nickname&gt;. ∀ Our new life together
starts tomorrow.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="638">All right, &lt;nickname&gt;. ∀ Our new life together
starts tomorrow.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="639">Hmmm... What should I do?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Oh, maybe if I...
No, that won't work.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="640">Eek!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Oh, I'm so sorry. I was completely lost in thought.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="641">Huh? I haven't seen you before. Are you here to sightsee?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="642">Ooh! You're the one who's staying at that farm!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
My name is Marie. It's nice to meet you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="643">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;. It's good to see you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="644">It's awfully nice of you to drop by. Patrons at this library
are few and far between.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="645">Forgive me for earlier. When I'm deep in thought,
I don't see what's around me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="646">Is something troubling you?</Entry>
  <Entry Index="647">You should be more careful.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="648">No, that's not it. I'm writing my own novel, but I'm at
something of an impasse, so I'm trying to work it out.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="649">Thanks for your concern.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="650">Please stop by whenever you're in the literary mood.
I'm sure we have plenty of books that can help
or inspire you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="651">I truly do apologize. I'll be more attentive from now on.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="652">Feel free to read any book that catches your eye.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="653">This isn't it. Not this one, either... Talk about odd.
Where did it go?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="654">Oh, my! What a surprise. Please try not to scare me
like that, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Hm? You want to know what I was doing?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="655">Welcome. Did you come to read some books? Hm?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You want to know what I was doing?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="656">Well, in truth, I'm writing a novel right now, and there's
a book somewhere in here I'd like to use as a reference.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I think it's here on the first floor, but...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="657">Oh, I know, &lt;playername&gt;! I'm terribly sorry,
but would you be willing to help me look for it?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="658">Consider that book bound! Er, found!</Entry>
  <Entry Index="659">No can do. Sorry.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="660">Truly?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Okay, the book I'm looking for is...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="661">I'm grateful for your help. Why don't you start
over there?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="662">Hmmm... It's not here.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Do you see it over there, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="663">I see. Would you keep looking, then?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="664">Yes, that's it! So THAT'S where it was.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="665">Perfect. Now I can keep writing my novel. Thank you so
much, &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="666">Oh, of course. I apologize for making such a shameless
request.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'll look for it myself. See you, then.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="667">My day just improved tenfold. Now I can keep writing.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="668">Where could it have gone? I can't write without it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="669">*sigh*... *sniffle*
What a great story. *sob*&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="670">Oh... *sniffle* &lt;playername&gt;...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="671">Did someone make me cry, you ask?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="672">No, no. While I was organizing the Library, I came across
a certain book.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="673">I thought I might give it a read somewhere with a great
view, so I brought it here.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The story was so magnificent that I was moved to tears.
Books are powerful like that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="674">Thank you for your concern.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Has a book ever made you cry, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="675">Yeah. Books are love. Books are life.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="676">Mere words cannot move me.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="677">Being able to get so wrapped up in a book is sort
of magical, don't you think?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Oh, here's a thought. I'll give this book to you,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Maybe try giving it a read? Only if it looks interesting
to you, of course.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="678">You're welcome to it, really. I've already finished
reading it.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And besides, if I can, I'd like to share this feeling
with you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If you can be so moved over a book, I think it will find the
perfect home with you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="679">If you can be so moved over a book, I think it will find the
perfect home with you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="680">Great. So you'll take it?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="681">All right, I'm heading back. Take good care of that book,
won't you?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="682">Oh...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="683">So you haven't come across a book that's been able to
move you yet.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I hope you find one eventually. I'm sure it's out there
somewhere.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="684">Well, I have to be getting back. See you,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="685">This is a problem.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="686">Yes, it truly is.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="687">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="688">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="689">Hello, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If you've come to see Marie, you had best give up on that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="690">I'm not entirely sure what the problem is, but Marie's in
an extremely foul mood right now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="691">It's true. She refuses to speak to anyone. All she's done is
sulk in silence.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="692">I suppose she IS at that age.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="693">Maybe she'd be willing to speak with someone who's
closer to her age?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="694">I've got it! &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Could you find some way to ask her what's bothering her?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="695">I've got it! &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Could you find some way to ask her what's bothering her?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="696">You're just about the only person we can ask to do this.
So, please. Would you help?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="697">*sigh* That's a relief.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="698">We're counting on you. Go on up to the second floor.
That's where Marie is.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="699">...Huh? Is that what my parents told you?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="700">I'm so sorry for getting you wrapped up in this. I'm not in
a bad mood at all.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="701">I should explain it to them too, so let's go downstairs.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="702">I'm telling you, you've misunderstood. I was simply
pondering the theme for my next novel.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="703">Oh, was that all? I was all but certain we did something
to upset you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="704">I'm sorry.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="705">It's fine. More importantly, have you decided on
a theme yet?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="706">Well... No, not yet.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="707">Hmmm... Do you have any good ideas, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="708">I'm drawing a blank.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="709">What about...farm work?</Entry>
  <Entry Index="710">What about...Basil's work?</Entry>
  <Entry Index="711">Don't worry about it. It's difficult to answer such
a random question, I'm sure.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'll think it over a little more.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="712">Eureka! That's it! Why did I not think of that before?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="713">Oh, that's perfect. And you have a professional here
to consult.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="714">That's a great idea.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="715">Hey, I'd like to ask you a few things.
Are you free right now?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="716">Right. Now, please teach me everything you know. First...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="717">...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Hmmm. Okay, I think that's it. Thank you for answering
my questions.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="718">Oh, it's so late. Sorry for keeping you this long.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="719">But now I'm inspired to write a truly great novel.
I'll work extra hard to pay you back for all your help.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="720">Oh! My work, you say? What do you think, Marie?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="721">Hmmm...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
No, that's not very inspiring. I'm sorry to reject your idea
after you went to all the trouble to help.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="722">Oh...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="723">I'll think it over a little more. A good idea might come to
me eventually.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="724">Ummm... I think here should be okay. Let's continue our
previous discussion.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
&lt;playername&gt;, are you serious? I'll be hurt if you're
playing a prank on me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="725">Yes. I've read about marriage in so many books, and I've
always dreamed of experiencing it myself.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But I never would have believed it could happen to me
someday.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="726">Yes. I've read about marriage in so many books, and I've
always dreamed of experiencing it myself.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But I never would have believed it could happen to me
someday.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="727">Thank you. I couldn't be happier. Of course my reply
is a resounding yes.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="728">Yes. I love you, &lt;playername&gt;.
I hope you'll stay with me forever.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="729">Yes. I love you, &lt;playername&gt;.
I hope you'll stay with me forever.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="730">Now, I need to go tell my parents.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm sure they'll be shocked.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="731">So, you've finally decided.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm so happy for you, Marie.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="732">You've always been so meek that it's hard to imagine you
leaving the nest.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm getting emotional. It seems like only yesterday that
you were in diapers...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="733">Don't be ridiculous, Papa.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="734">No, no, I'm just kidding. But time really does fly by,
doesn't it?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You find someone you love, and before you know it,
you're getting married.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="735">No, no, I'm just kidding. But time really does fly by,
doesn't it?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You find someone you love, and before you know it,
you're getting married.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="736">Yes, children have a way of growing up right before your
very eyes.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
All we can do as parents is see you off with a smile.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Be happy, Marie.
And take good care of her, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="737">Papa... Mama... Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="738">Leave the wedding preparations to us.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
We'll speak with Thomas, reserve the venue, and contact
the townspeople.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The ceremony will be... Hmmm... Given all the preparations
that need to be made, it will probably be in about a week.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="739">Okay. I'll let you two handle it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="740">Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to see
&lt;playername&gt; and Marie joined in matrimony.
Let us begin.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="741">Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to see
&lt;playername&gt; and Marie joined in matrimony.
Let us begin.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="742">&lt;playername&gt;. Marie. Do you both hereby swear
to take each other as your sole partner for the rest
of your lives...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...To have and to hold, to respect and to cherish,
your hearts united no matter what may come?
For now, and forever?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="743">Marie, you're so beautiful. Please don't forget to come
see us at least once a week!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="744">Your smiles make my heart sing. &lt;playername&gt;, she's
our one and only daughter, so please make her happy!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="745">&lt;playername&gt;, now we'll be together for the rest of
our lives. I love you. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="746">&lt;playername&gt;, now we'll be together for the rest of
our lives. I love you. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="747">Today was like a dream.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
There's no greater joy than feeling so loved and
supported by everyone we know.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And my parents were delighted, too. I held it back for so
long, but once I saw them, I couldn't stop the tears.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'll be living here from now on.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="748">Oh, that's right.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I've been calling you &lt;playername&gt; until now, but...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I was thinking that maybe I should call you something else.
But what, exactly?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="749">Yes, I like that.
&lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="750">A different name would be better, right?
What would you prefer?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="751">Our new life starts tomorrow, &lt;nickname&gt;. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="752">Yes. I like that.
Our new life starts tomorrow, &lt;nickname&gt;. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="753">Oh, before I forget: I want to keep working at the
Library as I have been. Is that all right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="754">I've got something amazing to show you, Elly!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="755">You do, do you? Well, don't keep me in suspense!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="756">Get a load of THIS!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="757">Oh, for goodness' sake! How many times have I told you
that this is a sterile environment?! That means no bugs!
Ever!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="758">Heh heh heh. If you keep scowling, you're gonna
turn into a wrinkled old lady!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="759">Wh-What did you just...?!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="760">And where do you think you're going, for that matter?!
Get back here this instant!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="761">Oh! You're not from this town, are you?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="762">I'm so sorry about all this. You're &lt;playername&gt;,
the one who came to work on the farm, right?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The whole town has been abuzz ever since your arrival.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="763">I'm so sorry about all this. You're &lt;playername&gt;,

  <Entry Index="764">My name is Elly. I'm the nurse at this Clinic.
It's a pleasure to meet you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="765">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;.
Have you come for a check-up?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="766">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;.
Have you come for a check-up?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="767">Is that so?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You should make a habit of seeing the doctor
on a regular basis. It's important to establish
a good self-care regimen.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="768">And speaking of "seeing"...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="769">Stop hiding behind &lt;playername&gt; and look me
in the eye, Yu!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="770">Stop hiding behind &lt;playername&gt; and look me
in the eye, Yu!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="771">Fine, you meanie!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="772">Ugh... He's a natural-born prankster, I swear.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="773">All I did was show you a bug.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="774">You know I hate insects.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="775">That's why I keep bringing 'em to you.
It's so you'll get over it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="776">*sigh* You always have a comeback for everything.
Who did you learn that from, I wonder?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="777">You understand how I feel, don'tcha?
Being a guy and all.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="778">You understand how I feel, don'tcha?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="779">Yeah, totally. What's bugging her?</Entry>
  <Entry Index="780">You shouldn't harass people.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="781">I knew you would. You 'n me are gonna be best buds!
I can tell!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="782">Honestly, Yu...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="783">Please don't encourage him, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
He'll only use it as an excuse to wreak more havoc.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="784">Please don't encourage him, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
He'll only use it as an excuse to wreak more havoc.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="785">...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Waaaaah!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="786">Thank you for scolding him. And don't worry--those
were crocodile tears, I assure you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
He's not used to being reprimanded by people other
than me, that's all.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I hope it will make him think twice the next time
he's about to pull some of his usual antics.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="787">I understand how Yu feels.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Children want attention, so they purposefully play tricks
on people they like.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="788">I'm sick and tired of his nonsense.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="789">What's the matter, &lt;playername&gt;?
Are you feeling unwell?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="790">What's the matter, &lt;playername&gt;?
Are you feeling unwell?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="791">Hm? You...simply came to see me, you say?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Oh, &lt;playername&gt;. You're awfully kind.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
We don't have any patients at the moment, so I can chat
for a little while.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="794">Jeff! What happened?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="795">Owww...
Could you call the doctor?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="796">Y-Yes, of course!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
D-Doctor! Doctor, come quickly!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="797">Doctor, here's Jeff's medicine.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="798">Right. Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="799">Hold on now, Elly. This isn't what I prescribed!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="800">Oh! You're right.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I-I'm so sorry. I'll go get the correct medicine right away!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="801">W-Will I be okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="802">I can't apologize enough, Doctor.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="803">I noticed the mix-up before I gave it to him, so everything
is all right. Just be careful from now on.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="804">Now, be sure to take this every day. Don't miss a dose.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="805">Appreciate it, Doctor. If we're done here,
then I'd better get back to the store.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="806">*sigh* To think I made the same error once again...
I'm mortified.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I truly am useless. Am I even fit to be a nurse?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="807">Don't let one mistake hold you back.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="808">...</Entry>
  <Entry Index="809">You're right, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If I stumble once and give up without a fight, then I'll
never get anywhere.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="810">You're right, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If I stumble once and give up without a fight, then I'll
never get anywhere.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="811">What I need to do now is turn my mistakes into learning
opportunities so that I don't repeat them in the future.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="812">I must make sure I never grab the wrong medicine again.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
To that end, I will engrave today's encounter into my
heart so that I never jeopardize another patient's health.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Thank you for your encouragement, &lt;playername&gt;.
My outlook feels considerably brighter thanks to you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="814">Maybe this entire career path has been a waste of time...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm sorry to sour the mood, but I don't really feel like
talking to anyone right now.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
We'll have to chat some other time.
I hope you can understand.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
See you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="815">Elly is a hard worker.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="816">I must not grow complacent.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="817">&lt;playername&gt;, it's good to see you.
&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="818">Welcome...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="819">Chin up, Elly, dear.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="820">Right...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="821">She's a bit deflated at the moment, you see.
She made a meal for Yu, but...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...he took one bite of it, said he'd lost his appetite,
and ran outside.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="822">...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="823">My legs being what they are, I can't go out after him.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="824">Oh, I have a fabulous idea! Would you bring him back
for us, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Knowing him, I'm certain he's hanging around
by the Church.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="825">Refuse</Entry>
  <Entry Index="826">Accept</Entry>
  <Entry Index="827">It's all right. I wouldn't know a tablespoon of salt from
a cup of sugar, so it's no wonder he hated it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="828">Oh, that is not true and you know it, dear. Yu will come
back before long.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="829">...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="830">*sniffle* I'm so sorry, Elly.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You made it just for me, but I told you I didn't want it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="831">No, it's fine. I'm sorry too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="832">Elly forgives you, so there's no need to cry anymore, Yu.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="833">Okay. Sorry again, Big Sis.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="834">Splendid! Then if you'll be so kind as to bring him
back for us...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="835">Oh! Hey, mister.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="836">Oh! Hey there, lady.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="837">My sister's real sad? N-Now I feel bad.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But her cooking... No, never mind.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's okay. I'll go back.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="838">I'm sorry for, uh...running away without saying anything,
Elly.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="839">No, it's fine. I shouldn't have tried to force you to eat it.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'll practice more so I can make food that will really get
your tummy rumbling, okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="840">Yeah! Sounds good!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="841">Phew. Thank goodness. I'm sorry for getting you wrapped
up in this, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm fond of the rather...we'll say "straightforward"...food
Elly makes, so it hasn't bothered me, but...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
From now on, I'll keep Yu's tastes in mind and give Elly
some cooking lessons.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="842">Thanks, &lt;playername&gt;.
Oh, but before you go...!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="843">Thanks, &lt;playername&gt;.
Oh, but before you go...!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="844">By way of thanks, I'd like to give you these pressed
flowers I made a while back. Will you take them?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="845">Good. I'm feeling better already.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="846">Well, now that Yu has come home, I should get back in the
kitchen to practice my cooking.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="847">Whaaat?! You're gonna make MORE food?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="848">I'm glad Yu came back.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="849">Thanks, &lt;playername&gt;.
You're a peach.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="850">I have to learn to make better food. Not just for my sake,
but for Yu's as well.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="851">I'm not going to mix up my salt and sugar today,
no matter what.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="852">...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="853">*sigh* I don't like what happens when Elly's
in the kitchen...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="855">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="856">Hm? I don't seem like the beach-going type, you say?
Hee hee, I can't really argue with that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="857">But when my parents were alive, we'd often come here
as a family.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I made a lot of fond memories with them here.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="858">When I'm sad or feeling introspective, this is my favorite
place to stop and reflect.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Somehow, I get the feeling that my parents can hear me
here, you know?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="859">I came today because I'm at something of a loss with Yu.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="860">That boy loves making mischief. And he never listens
to a word I say.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
For so many years now, I've tried to raise him right
in Mom's absence.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I do it because I don't want him to feel lonely or sad
with Mom gone.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But I'm wondering now if maybe I've been too soft on him.
If I'm to blame for his bad behavior.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
What do you think, &lt;playername&gt;?
I want your honest opinion.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="864">I thought you might say that. If other people view it that
way, then I really MUST be spoiling him.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
*sigh* I've lost all confidence now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="865">Well, I'm going to head back.
Thank you for listening to me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="866">I truly appreciate it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="867">I agree. I might be biased, but he's really not
a bad kid at heart.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm sure he's just at that tender age.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="868">I was at wits' end over this, but one word from you was

You're serious about this?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="874">...Yes.
I know how you feel.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I can't claim to understand all the nuances of love, but...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I can say one thing with certainty: you're an extremely
special person to me.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
So what I'm trying to say is...I feel the same way.
Thank you for putting it into words.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

  <Entry Index="1050">Eee! ∀ Look! It's on its way to being a culinary
masterpiece, isn't it?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Well, &lt;playername&gt;? Doesn't it look yummy?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1051">It looks surprisingly decent.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1052">Your technique is, uh...rustic.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1053">You didn't need that "surprisingly" part, you know!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1054">But, um, to be honest...I didn't think it would turn out this
well either.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1055">Rick always says he can't trust me in the kitchen. All he
lets me do is set the table and carry out the food.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1056">He does everything else all by himself. I know I can do
more if I try, but he treats me like I'm a little kid.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1057">Today, however, proved that I CAN cook! I'm gonna show
off just how good it turned out to Rick and Mama!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1058">Hee hee. I will say, having you there supervising things
gave me lots of extra confidence.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You didn't get mad or impatient with me, either.
I wouldn't have been able to do it without you. Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1059">Boy, time sure does fly when you're cracking eggs.
I really want to cook with you again sometime,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1060">Don't forget about my present! I hope you really like the
pudding I made. It turned out great, in my humble opinion!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1061">I'll see you later, then. Thanks again for helping me!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1062">Aww... So you think I'm just in the way too,
&lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Rick always says he can't trust me in the kitchen. All he
lets me do is set the table and carry out the food.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
He does everything else all by himself. I know I can do
more if I try, but he treats me like I'm a little kid.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1063">Sure, I realize I probably seem a little flaky and
unreliable to you and Rick, but I...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1064">...Actually, let's not take a trip to sadtown right now,
&lt;playername&gt;. We worked hard to cook this, so let's
eat!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1065">Mmm! That was super yummy. Probably because you
were there to help me with it, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1066">I'll see you later, then. Thanks for helping me!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1067">Ugh! Stupid Rick! You don't understand ANYTHING!
I hate you!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1068">Wah! &lt;playername&gt;?!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1069">O-Oh, um, it's nothing. Never mind. Say, can I bend your
ear for a minute?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'd really appreciate if you could help me with a little
something.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1070">You're the best. Come on, it's this way.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1071">Hmmm. I think here is good. I should be able to find what
I'm looking for...I hope.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1072">See, um, Mama hasn't been feeling so hot today. It's not
so serious that she needs to go to the Clinic...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But she doesn't have as much energy as usual, and she
couldn't finish her breakfast. I'm kinda worried.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1073">That's why I decided to go pick some of her favorite
flowers and give her a biiig bouquet as a present!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1074">It IS a great idea, isn't it? I knew you would agree with
me, &lt;playername&gt;. ♪&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Will you help me find some extra-lovely flowers
for the bouquet?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1075">Thanks, &lt;playername&gt;. Remember, only the best
of the best of the BEST will do for Mama's bouquet,
all right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1076">Hmmm... I think a bigger flower would look really nice
with this.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1077">That flower is wonderfully colorful and pretty, don't you
think? I bet Mama will really like that one.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1078">Having a big variety of different flowers will make it
super bright and pretty, I'm sure!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1079">Oh! &lt;playername&gt;, look! Don't you think the flowers
over there are pretty?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1080">No, the one to the left of that one.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1081">Whoops! I got them mixed up. To the right, to the right.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1082">No, that's too far, &lt;playername&gt;! Come back this
way. Now go a little farther!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1083">Huh? That's weird. This isn't the flower I thought it was.
Oopsie doodles!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1084">Oh, look over there! THAT one! I'm sure THAT has to be
a really rare flower!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1085">What's next, "fetch"?</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1086">I've had enough!</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1087">I've had enough!</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1088">Oh... I-I'm sorry, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1089">I got so wrapped up in the flowers that I wasn't being
considerate, was I? I'm sorry.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
When you agreed to help me, I got totally carried away in
my excitement. I hope you can forgive me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1090">Um, Mama really IS feeling bad today, though. And Rick
HAS been extra-super busy with the store.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I said I wanted to help, but he totally ignored me and
continued working.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I want to help. I want to do things for my family.
But I keep getting treated like a kid. So I got mad
and left.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Then I ran into you, &lt;playername&gt;, and you were so
accommodating that I couldn't help myself.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I got super bossy and started demanding all sorts of
things from you as a way of lashing out about being
ignored.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1091">You, um...you aren't mad at me, are you? You aren't upset
because I'm too bossy and demanding?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1092">Thanks, &lt;playername&gt;. I feel better now that you
listened to me vent.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1093">Hm? You say I could make a difference by doing simple
housework and cleaning? I...guess I could manage that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1094">Y'know what, that's a good point. I can find ways to help
on my own and do them without being asked.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1095">Just you watch, &lt;playername&gt;! I'm gonna bust my
butt and help my family like a...a super-helpful person!
Yeah!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1096">Oh, and I should probably say sorry to Rick for yelling at
him, too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1097">Huh? &lt;playername&gt;, wait! Don't go!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1098">Aww...too late. Though...I guess I WAS taking advantage
of the situation.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I got bossy and made all kinds of demands. That wasn't
right. I'm really sorry, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1099">Okay, now that I've had a minute to come back down to
earth... Sure is hard to think when you're that surprised.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1100">Can you repeat what you said before?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1101">So I WASN'T dreaming! Well, sweep my floors and call
me spotless! Yippee!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Of COURSE I'll happily be your girlfriend. As long as you
don't feel like you're settling!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

huh?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1111"></Entry>
  <Entry Index="1112">So, what happened was, a guest who came to our inn
wound up getting their favorite outfit dirty.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
So they were talking my ear off about how to take care
of a stain on white fabric.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1113">If one of our guests left disappointed, then I'd be
disappointed too. I won't settle for less than total
satisfaction.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1114">That's why I wanted to help them, but regular ol' soap
isn't up to snuff for the mega-stain I'm dealing with.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1115">Let's find a stronger detergent.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1116">Let's do something to cheer you up.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1117">A stronger detergent, huh? Yeah, to be fair, having
something like than on hand DOES sound...well,
handy as heck.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I hope the General Store has it. Not that I remember
seeing anything like that the last time I was there...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Well, I'll never know if I don't check. Will you come with
me, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1119">I can give you some regular soap, but we don't stock the
sort of detergent you're looking for.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1120">Sorry, Ran. I wish I could help you, but I'm afraid our
stock says otherwise.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1121">Hey, don't worry about it. I just came to check on the off
chance that you might have it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1122">At least you tried. Maybe you can find someone around
town who might know where to find something like that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1123">An expert on all things immaculate, huh? Good idea!
I'll ask around!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1124">Thanks so much for coming with me, &lt;playername&gt;.
I'll take it from here.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1125">Thanks so much for coming with me, &lt;playername&gt;.

Awww, boo! This my favorite outfit!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1135">Oh, you shouldn't rub mud stains like that. It'll only make

  <Entry Index="1136">Really? Then what do I gotta do?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1137">Uhhh... You gotta dry 'em first, then use a brush to get
the mud out. Yeah.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Then you kinda beat it with a damp towel.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1153">By all means, we are at your disposal. In fact, Ran is here
today too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1154"></Entry>
  <Entry Index="1155">She's been coming to read at the Library frequently as
of late. We even chat on occasion.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1156">...What do we chat about, you ask? If you're so curious,
you should ask her directly.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
She went upstairs to look through the books on the
second floor.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1157">...Oooh, I see. Hmmm...
You learn something new every day.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Oh, that's the last page.
Better find another book.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1160">Sorry, did you say something earlier? I was so absorbed in

Awww, you're so sweet!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1164">Marie might've told you, but lately, I've been coming to
the Library whenever I have a little free time.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Remember how I was all worried about how to clean a
guest's clothes a while back?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1165">Well, when I seized victory over that stain and gave the
guest's clothes back, they were thrilled. And so was I!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1166">So I started wondering if there was anything else I could
do to make our guests happy.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And then it hit me that I could act as a tour guide, telling
them about good spots around town and local specialties.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
That way, I can promote the town and make our guests
happy in one fell swoop! Two birds, one stone, no?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1167">But when I started to mull over what to talk about,
I realized that I actually don't know that much about
this place.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1168">That's why I started coming to the Library to brush up
on my expertise as a local!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1169">Glad you "Ran" with this idea!</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1170">Wow, so you CAN read!</Entry>

open it for a little while. Let's get going, then.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1203">Huh? Marie and &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1204">Huh? Marie and &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1205">What're you doing here?
Ooh, are you on a date?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1206">What're you doing here?
Ooh, are you on a date?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1207">Going to the Library on a date?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1208">Going to the Library on a date?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1209">Wow, so you're a bookworm too, huh, &lt;playername&gt;?
That's a bit of a surprise.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1210">Marie's my book advisor today.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1211">Reading is the worst.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1212">That's right. I'm going to pick out some books that I think
&lt;playername&gt; will like.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1213">Let me get this straight: you hate reading, but you're
going to the Library?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1214">H-Huh? My plan today is to pick out some books that
I think &lt;playername&gt; will like.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1215">Huh. That sounds nice.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1216">Same! I don't read very much, so I don't know which books
are good.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1217">No need to worry. There's a book for every mood and
every interest. I'm sure I can find some that you two
will like.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1218">You think there's a book that's up my alley, even?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1219">Hmmm... What about an adventure book that helps expand
your cooking capabilities at the same time?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Gourmand General is a book about a general who
secretly travels the country searching for the ultimate
ingredient.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
He encounters a wide variety of food on his journey, and
there are detailed recipes for all of them at the end.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1220">Wow! That sounds really cool!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1221">Yes, it's fascinating. And the writing utilizes the literary
device of poetic justice, making it an uplifting read.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
His catchphrase is: "Can you keep your eyes on my knife?"
When his legendary kitchen knife flashes, villains fall.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1222">Hey, what about me? Is there a book I'd like?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1223">For you, Popuri...
How about My Uncle's a Wizard?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's a love story about a simple girl who goes to the
castle ball and falls in love with the prince.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Her uncle's actually a wizard, and he uses his magic to
make beautiful clothes for his niece. It's a feel-good
story.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1224">Wow, that sounds amazing!
I've gotta read that!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The Library has sooo many books that I didn't feel like
trying to comb through them before, but now...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1225">Guess you just have to know where to look, huh? I might
enjoy reading if you pick out books for me, Marie.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1226">Right?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm always trying my hardest to get people who don't
read into the Library. So please, come borrow some
books.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1227">Yeah, okay!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1228">I'm on the hook for an errand for Lillia today, so I've
gotta get to Popuri's house now.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But I'll definitely come later to borrow that book you
just mentioned.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1229">I wanna hear about more books too, so I'll come by the
Library sometime. ♪&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
See ya, Marie and &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1230"></Entry>
  <Entry Index="1231">It sounds like their interest was piqued by the books
I recommended.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm always so happy to hear that someone's taken
an interest in reading.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1232">I'm sure it's all thanks to you, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Ever since I got to know you, I feel like more and more
people have been coming to the Library.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1233">And more people talk to me now, too.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
They want me to recommend books, like today, or to find
books that will help them with their own hobbies or
research.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I think it's because I've become a little more personable
ever since I met you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Maybe that's why the townspeople chat with me more
readily now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1234">You've helped me grow and change.
Thanks, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1235">Now, it's getting a little late, but let's head to the
Library.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I still haven't picked out any books for YOU to read,
and that's what I'm most looking forward to.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1236">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;. I'm so pleased to see you, but...
We've already closed for the evening. My apologies.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1237">I think I will take a stroll up the mountain.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Inspiration for my novels tends to strike most while I'm
out walking around.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1238">Huh? You want to come with me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1239">Of course I'd welcome the company.
Let's take a stroll together.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1240">Aaah. This is refreshing. Coming here always stokes the
fires of my imagination.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1241">And I'm using the summit here as inspiration for
my next story.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1242">This time, I'm planning on writing a story that's a mix
between an old alpine myth and a romance novel.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's a tragic love story between someone who becomes a
cursed werewolf and the mountain goddess.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The werewolf doesn't age because of the curse, and one
day meets the mountain goddess and falls in love.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But the goddess knows how fervently the werewolf
wants to be human again, and so she grants their wish.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1243">The werewolf becomes human again, but can no longer
see their beloved mountain goddess now that the curse
is gone.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
They learn that losses and gains both come
at a heavy price.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1244">And so the human sets off once more on the path of
mortality, conflict brewing in their heart. That's how it
ends.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
What do you think?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1245">Exciting AND inspiring!</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1246">That's pretty grim, Marie.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1247">Th-Thanks. It's pretty embarrassing to talk about it
when I haven't finished it yet.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But your encouragement has renewed my motivation.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1248">I-I suppose it is rather esoteric.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But...I would like it to reach a wide audience, so...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1249">I value your feedback, so I'll try revising it to make
it simpler.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1250">You're my light, you know.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1251">A world without you is a world shrouded in darkness.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1252">But your happiness is paramount.
If you're happy, then I'll be happy.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Because...I love you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1253">Hmmm... But when you're trying to confess your feelings
to someone...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Writing "I love you" is a little cliched, isn't it?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1254">Oh! What is it, &lt;playername&gt;?
Wait... Oh...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1255">U-Um... Did I just...say all of those sappy lines out loud?
How mortifying.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
No, no! I was just thinking about how I should end
my novel. Um... I'm sorry.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1256">I was thinking... I want to give them a happy ending now.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I mean, it would be like me never being able to see you
again for the rest of my life. I couldn't bear that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1257">I feel like it would be inauthentic to write a story
of doomed romance when I'm this happy.
I'm with you, after all.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Thank you for helping me write our own story
of companionship, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1258">Goodness, &lt;playername&gt;.
You brought it up so suddenly that I didn't know what
to do with myself.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1259">Goodness, &lt;playername&gt;.
You brought it up so suddenly that I didn't know what
to do with myself.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1260">Will you say it just one more time?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1261">Yes...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I've been so preoccupied with my family that I dared not
even dream of having a boyfriend.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I don't know what to do. I'm beside myself with happiness,
truly.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If you'll have me, then I am yours. I accept,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1262">Yes...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1263">So from now on, we're dating.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I feel like I have butterflies in my stomach. Deep breaths,
Elly, deep breaths... I'm not dreaming, right?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I-In any case, I have work to finish yet, so I must be
getting back.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I can't wait until our first date, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1265">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;.
Did you come to see me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1266">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;.
Did you come to see me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1267">You...want to go out somewhere?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Yes...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1268">There's some time yet before supper, and it WOULD be
nice to engage in some self-care for a change.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Oh, but please wait a moment. I can't go out with my hair
looking like this.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Um, would you give me a little time to get myself ready?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1269">I'll be right back.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1270">I'm sorry for the wait! All right, let's be off.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1271">Oh, hey, it's my sister.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Kinda weird for her to be outside this late.
What're those two up to?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1272">Are you worried about her?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1273">N-No... Nothing like that. I'm just kinda suspicious of what
they might be doing, that's all.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1274">Do you wanna spy on them? We'll have to be quiet so we
don't get found!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1275">Okay!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1276">They're...not doing anything.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1277">No, hang on a sec.
I think they're playing together.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Kinda like you and me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1278">Playing, huh?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's kinda funky to think of my sister playing around.
She's a grown-up.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1279">You're the one who's weird for thinking that, Yu.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Elly's always busy with work and the house and stuff.
Of course she'd wanna hang out with her friend
sometimes.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1280">Huh... Guess you're right.
Elly usually doesn't have fun.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
She's always makin' food for us, cleaning, doing laundry...
And then she works at the Clinic on top of it all.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1281">I guess that's why it feels weird to see her walkin'
around outside.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1282">What's wrong, Yu?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1283">...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1284">I'm goin' home.
There's something I've gotta do.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
See you tomorrow, Mei.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1285">What's going on?
You're acting strange, Yu.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1286">*sigh* It feels like it's been a lifetime since I've had
a nice, long chat like this.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Thanks, &lt;playername&gt;. I had a great time finally
being able to let my hair down a little.
Good thing I brushed it! ♪&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1288">But I think I'd better be getting back home soon.
I still have to make supper.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And I'm worried that Yu might be bothering Grandma
with all his whining.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1289">I'm sure he's on his best behavior.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1290">Yeah, "Yu" had better rein him in.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1291">I wonder... Well, if you say so, &lt;playername&gt;, I'll take
your word for it.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Let's get going.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1297">Um... This is for you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1298">Are these...chore coupons?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1299">Yep.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If you ever wanna go out and have fun again...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

more time to play.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1302">What ever am I going to do with you?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Thank you, little brother.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1303">Heh heh...
Okay, I'm gonna go home now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1304">&lt;playername&gt;, I'm just...
I'm beaming right now. Can you tell?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1305">&lt;playername&gt;, I'm just...
I'm beaming right now. Can you tell?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1306">He noticed that I couldn't spend much time with you, so
he tried to help out in his own way. It's a lovely gift...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

I want to keep them as a memento of his selflessness.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1309">That's the first time I've seen Elly with such a happy look
on her face.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1310">My, my. &lt;playername&gt;. Welcome.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1311">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;.
We were just talking about you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1312">Let me take this opportunity to thank you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm so grateful to you for choosing Elly as your girlfriend.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
All her time's been spent taking care of us, so she's never
had a chance to fall in love.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I've always regretted that.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I felt guilty that I was making her waste her most tender
years being a caretaker.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1314">No, no. Elly adores you and Yu. She wouldn't consider
it a waste.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Though it was difficult watching her try so hard to be a
stand-in mother to Yu after their parents passed away.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
To be honest, we were all secretly worried for her.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1315">But you know, &lt;playername&gt;...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
She's changed so much ever since you came to town.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1316">Until now, she was always worried about Yu's mischief,
or her errors at work, or her clumsiness in the kitchen.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
She'd mope around all day, lost in thought. She was
always so pessimistic.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1317">But a while back, she was dashing to and fro, all atwitter
with excitement. So I asked her what was going on.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
She said she needed to brush her hair because she had a
date with you, but she couldn't find her brush.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

herself.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

you know.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1324">Right. And recently--&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1325">Oh, speak of the devil... Well, angel, really.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1330">I never knew that Grandma and Thomas were so worried
about me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1331">But they're right.

for being grateful.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

for being grateful.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But it's wonderful to have someone you can respect,
and who respects you in return.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I can't wait to spend more time with you,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1339">You want me to...show my gratitude?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1340">Hee hee. Goodness, &lt;playername&gt;. You're so
calculating.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Still, I think we have a lot of happy times ahead,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1341">Hee hee. Goodness, &lt;playername&gt;. You're so
calculating.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Still, I think we have a lot of happy times ahead,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1342">Hm? Oh. &lt;playername&gt;. Hello.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I was just opening my soul to the positive energies
of Mother Nature.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1343">Hm? Oh. I don't believe we've met.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm Jennifer. It's a pleasure.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I was just opening my soul to the positive energies
of Mother Nature.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1344">Can you feel them? They emanate in waves from the song
of the birds, from the light of the sun...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's as if the world itself is blessing the advent
of a brand new day. Don't you agree?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1345">Um, yeah, let's back it up a little.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1346">Yeah, my chakras are totally aligned.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1347">Ah, could it be that you're one of the many unfortunate
souls incapable of feeling the world's natural energies?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I had the impression that you were considerably more...
special than that. Ah, well. We all make mistakes.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Be seeing you, then.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1348">And mine! I see you are someone who understands these
esoteric truths. Lovely.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
When I bring up this subject, most people simply end
the conversation with a puzzled expression.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1349">And mine! I see you are someone who understands these
esoteric truths. Lovely.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
When I bring up this subject, most people simply end the
conversation with a puzzled expression.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
By the by, who are you?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Aha. You're that farmer everyone speaks so highly of.
I'd been hoping to meet you someday.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
To farm is to live in harmony with the earth and work
hand in hand with life itself. It fascinates me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1350">I spend nights at the Inn, but the rest of the time,
you can generally find me here in my tent.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Come visit me again if your energies inspire you to.
There is much I want to ask you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1351">Ah, yes. That works like this. You see, what happens is...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1352">Aha, I see. Fascinating.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1353">Oh. &lt;playername&gt;. Hello.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1354">Ah, good morning.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1355">What are we doing, you ask? Why, holding a meeting
between botanical aficionados.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1356">Yes. We were just examining this flower.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
We were noting what we observed and sharing our
thoughts with one another.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1357">Now, I've devoted much of my life to botany, but
Jennifer's knowledge eclipses even mine.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
She approaches botany with such a different point of
view that it brings my attention to things I never noticed.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Every now and again, we like to get together and
exchange notes.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1358">I must admit, I have little interest in fully exploring the
nuances of plant ecology...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But watching flowers bloom with the caress of the
morning sun is like communing with Mother Nature
Herself.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Even the gloomiest day becomes fulfilling and rewarding
after an encounter like that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1359">Now, many flowers fold tightly into buds during the day,
yet open with the touch of the sun. Why do you think that
is?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
PASSION!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The bees and insects that carry pollen are mostly active
in the morning, yes?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It is to entice those insects to them--to beguile them!--
that they unfurl their petals and release their sweet
scents.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If you listen carefully, you can almost hear the flowers
crying out, "Spread my love to the world!"&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1360">Er, actually, that's triggered by a temperature shift.
Not passion. When the bud's internal temperature
changes...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1361">Goodness, what a dry and lifeless answer. I do not mean
to deny the verity of science...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But to me, there is a romantic and spiritual aspect of
Mother Nature's workings that it fails to encapsulate.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1362">Different strokes, I guess.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1363">Yeah! Flower power!</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1364">Yes, very true. I think Jennifer's way of thinking is
uniquely expressive and imaginative.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1365">It is unfortunate that neither of you agree with my
interpretation, but ah well. Different strokes indeed.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1366">The people of this town are not quick to ostracize others
for holding differing points of view. I like that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1367">Ahaha. Thank you. I think you and I will be like two peas in
a pod...or two buds on a branch, as it were.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1368">True, true. Everyone has their own internal compass by
which they navigate the world on their own terms.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1369">I think it's a good thing that there are so many different,
yet equally valid ways of viewing the world.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Whether you look at them scientifically or romantically,
both viewpoints stem from the same love of plants.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1370">Oh, dear, would you look at the time? I really must be
getting home.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I think I've taken enough notes, so if you don't mind,
I'll excuse myself for today.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1371">Come to think of it, what brings you up the mountain this
early in the morning, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Did you have some business up here?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1372">Hm? Your feet simply led you in this direction?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I see. The aura of the mountain must have drawn you in.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I KNEW there was some special energy to this mountain...
Something that tugs and pulls at the soul.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1373">Ahaha. You know? I think our budding friendship may
blossom into something special.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1374">Oh. &lt;playername&gt;. Hello.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You have perfect timing.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1375">Look at this lake.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Its serene aura. Its glittering surface. This lake is
exquisitely beautiful.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1376">It is a source of life-giving water for the townsfolk...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And, perhaps more importantly, it is the holy abode of the
town's spiritual guardian.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1377">My, do you doubt me? It's true.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I occasionally feel a distinctly divine presence when I visit
this lake.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1378">But I digress. Allow me to get to the point. Would you
believe me if I told you that this lake...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...This splendid, magnificent lake...
HAS NO NAME?!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1379">Could there be any greater blasphemy?
No, I think not.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1380">Thus, I resolved to come up with a name befitting this
gorgeous lake so filled with solemn natural energies.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And while I was pondering this quandary, you arrived.
It is almost as if Mother Nature guided you to me
Herself, no?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1381">Will you answer Her calling and assist me in devising an
appropriate name for the lake?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1382">What sort of name do you think would be most fitting?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1383">Something angelic.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1384">Something mystical.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1385">Something dignified.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1386">An angelic name?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1387">Hrm. I can see how this would be a place where even
angels might come to rest their wings. Interesting.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1388">You know, you have an unexpectedly poetic aesthetic
sense. I may have to revise my opinion of you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1389">A mystical name? Hrm.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
A good choice. A name that conveys the otherworldly,
enigmatic properties this lake possesses would indeed be
fitting.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1390">A dignified name?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1391">Well, of course the name must possess an air of nobility.
I thought that obvious.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
To give this lake a mere common name would be
blasphemy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1392">Ah...! Wait a moment...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Your words...they have planted a seed of inspiration
within me!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I can feel it... The name of this lake is...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1393">ISABELLA!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Yes... Beauty. Mystery. Divinity. The name "Isabella"
encompasses all of its myriad nuances.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It is a name that truly suits this singular body of water
like no other.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Don't you agree?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1394">Ahaha. There. Aren't you glad we gave you the perfect
name, Isabella?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Thank you, &lt;playername&gt;. The true name of this lake
can be our little secret.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1395">Why aren't we going to tell the other townsfolk, you ask?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Goodness, why would we? We need not announce it to the
world. So long as we call Isabella by name, that is enough.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1396">Besides, that secrecy is what makes it truly special,
does it not?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1397">Well, Ms. Lillia?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1398">Oh, how lovely!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Thank you again, Jenny... Hm?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
My, my! If it isn't &lt;playername&gt;.
Hello, sweetie.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1399">Oh, how lovely!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Thank you again, Jenny... Hm?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
My, my! If it isn't &lt;playername&gt;.
Hello, sweetie.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1400">Hello, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1401">Hm? Ah, I am here to deliver a sachet of potpourri
to Ms. Lillia.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I make them with flowers I've found in the mountains
and dried.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
They are primarily for my personal satisfaction,
but I share them with others from time to time.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I think that this blend will help transport Ms. Lillia to the
mountains in spirit, if not in body.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1402">Jenny really does blend the best potpourri. Everything
she makes smells so wonderful.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I feel like an excitable little girl every time I hear she's
bringing another sachet by.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Oh, I do so love potpourri...if you couldn't guess from my
daughter's name.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1403">Actually, I was thinking of bringing some potpourri to
YOU later, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I specifically tailor each blend I make to the recipient's
tastes. May it transport you somewhere peaceful.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1404">I told you, THIS one is better!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1405">No, it ISN'T!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1406">Oh, dear. They're arguing again.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1407">And right when we have guests, too. I'm so very sorry.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
They really are sweet children, but somehow, they
always find a way to butt heads with one another.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1408">Oh? Yet open disagreement is a sign that they trust one
other enough to express their true feelings.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Of course, it isn't good to let one's temper take control
and say hurtful things or, heaven forbid, use violence.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But I can see no danger with those two. Their arguments
are an expression of their affection for one another.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1409">I must admit, I felt a small pang of jealousy. If only I, too,
had a partner with whom I could argue so passionately.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1410">Looking at Rick and Popuri, it is plain that they were
both raised with care and affection.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1411">Thanks in no small part to a wonderful and loving mother,
I'm sure.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1412">Oh, Jenny! That was so sweet! Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You know? Hearing you say that makes me feel much
better.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
For someone who marches to the beat of her own drum
as much as you do, Jenny, you make some very astute
observations.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1413">Ahaha. I like to think it is precisely for that reason that
I can, actually.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Perhaps that is why I've always cultivated a more free
and unrestrained worldview.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1414">Ugh, Riiick! Why do you always have to--&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1415">Me?! YOU'RE the one who's always--&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1416">...They may be arguing because they love each other,
but I still think I'm going to put a stop to it.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm really sorry. This should only take a minute.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1417">Arguing may be a sign of how much they care for each
other...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But I can't commend them for doing it to the extent that
it worries and annoys their mother.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1418">Hm? You seem surprised by how much I observe the
people around me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1419">Ahaha. To be honest, I generally take pains to not
interfere with the affairs of others.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1420">However, Ms. Lillia seemed rather vexed, so I thought to
make a special exception for her.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1421">Wow. You aren't a total space case.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1422">Wow. You have a great heart.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1423">Goodness, how rude. Me, a space case?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1424">I most certainly am no such thing. What about me would
ever make you think that?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1425">Oh? I'm flattered that you would think so...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1426">But I'm afraid that I am not a particularly kind person
at heart.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1427">I simply prioritize harmony, that's all. And in order to
maintain a peaceful coexistence with others...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It is critical to focus on the merits and talents of
everyone around you, rather than their faults.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
After all, you must first give love and respect if you want
to receive it in turn.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
That goes not just for human beings, but for animals and
even nature itself.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I am simply putting that concept into practice. That is all.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1428">Goodness, listen to me. Here I am, talking your ear off.
My apologies.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
For some reason, talking with you seems to loosen my
tongue and I end up prattling on for hours.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1429">Well, I am very flattered by your compliment.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's odd. For some reason, being with you puts me at ease.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Perhaps our souls are resonating on a similar
wavelength. Aha ha ha.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1430">By the by, Ms. Lillia certainly is taking some time
to return.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Hrm. Perhaps I will take my leave, then.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1431">Here. I believe this will be a quiet enough spot for us to
continue our discussion.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
That you have presented me with such a special token
means, I presume, that you would like for us to begin
dating?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1432">Here. I believe this will be a quiet enough spot for us to

  <Entry Index="1433">I see. I accept.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1434">Well, I AM in love with you, after all. Both as a person
and as an integral aspect of the natural world.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You are a person who loves and respects the world, living
hand in hand with Mother Nature.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
How could I not love someone like you?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1436">Excellent. Our relationship is now one of man and woman
entwined in romance.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I vow that I shall offer to you every last ounce of love
that I possess.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I look forward to seeing how we continue to resonate in
body and soul, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1437">Excellent. Our relationship is now one of two women

I look forward to seeing how we continue to resonate in
body and soul, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;
</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1438">Ah, &lt;playername&gt;. Just who I wanted to see.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You have excellent timing. I'm about to put on a pot
of tea.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Would you care to join me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1439">Wonderful. Could I ask you to step outside and wait
a moment, then?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1440">Well? Does it suit your palate?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1441">I'm glad.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It is a special herbal tea that I blended myself.
I'm delighted you enjoy it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1442">Why, yes. It IS made from herbs I picked just this morning.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1443">Even without going to a store, you can make delicious and
nourishing meals using what can be found in nature alone.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1444">Of course, you are a farmer. I expect you're the last
person who needs this sort of lecture.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1445">Do I not purchase anything from stores? Well, as much as
I wish otherwise, there are things I cannot find
elsewhere.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1446">But to buy things, one first needs to have the requisite
money. I prefer to avoid handling money as much as I can.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I want to live my life in tune with Mother Nature. Only
the barest minimum of money is plenty sufficient for me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1447">Besides, an excess of money can easily lead one astray.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1448">Have I ever spoken to you of my past?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I was born into a very wealthy family.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Papa spent his life solving every issue he had with money.
Mama was raised like a princess.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
For as long as I can remember, I was told over and over
that I must grow up to be a proper lady and a good wife.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1449">I grew sick of hearing that, as you might imagine.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1450">I am aware that one needs money to get by in this world,
and that being destitute can pose its own problems.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But I believe our more pressing concern should be finding
our own path to happiness, regardless of finances. &lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1451">I could not see myself ever being truly happy in that
home. Thus, I cast it all aside and ran away.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And please don't bother lecturing me on how that was a
foolish choice by a naïve rich girl. I've heard that one
enough.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1452">I bet your parents are worried.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1453">Happiness trumps wealthiness.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1454">Oh? I wouldn't be so sure.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I had no intention of fulfilling the role they assigned to
me. I expect I would have been dismissed eventually.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1455">I knew you would understand.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1456">Happiness is something we can only decide for ourselves.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Whether it be through connections with others, wealth,
or becoming one with nature...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Everyone must find their own answer.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1457">To me, happiness is attuning with nature and spending
time with someone who loves me, chatting and smiling all
the while.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1458">I do not regret running away from home one bit. In fact,
not a single day has passed where I haven't felt satisfied.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Now, I wake by the twittering of the birds, breathe in
fresh mountain air, and sip delicious herbal tea.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1459">THAT is the true meaning of "richness"--richness of the
body and soul. I could not dream of a more fulfilling life.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Living in harmony with nature and basking in the serenity
of peace... This is the happiest I've ever been.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1460">And not only that, I have been blessed with a wonderful
boyfriend in you, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I believe it is vital for us as human beings to cultivate
such precious relationships.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1461">Not only that, I have been blessed with
a wonderful girlfriend in you, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I believe it is vital for us as human beings to cultivate

  <Entry Index="1462">...There I go, prattling on again. About uninteresting
stories from my past, no less. I apologize.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1463">Though I DID mean to tell you about it someday. You are
my boyfriend, and you are important to me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1464">Though I DID mean to tell you about it someday. You are
my girlfriend, and you are important to me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1465">My. What brings you here at this hour,
&lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1466">You simply came to visit me?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Ahaha. Oh, you flatterer, you. I don't advise being out and
about at this hour, though. It isn't safe.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Wait just a moment. I'll go and put on some tea for us.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1467">I...feel kind of funny...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1468">Ah! Are you awake? How do you feel?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1469">I had half a mind to take you to the Clinic, but you didn't
seem to have a fever, so I simply observed you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Given how you look, it seems there is nothing to worry
about.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1470">Still, it would be best if you kept your exertion to a
minimum. You may stay here until you have fully
recovered.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Good night, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1471">Ah. Are you awake?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1472">I made some spiced hot milk and rice porridge for you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It ought to warm you and help you relax. I'll bring it over
in a moment.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1473">Still...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It was quite a shock to see someone as full of vim and
vigor as you suddenly keel over out of nowhere.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I understand that you enjoy your work, but perhaps you
ought to go about it in a more leisurely fashion, hm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1474">I have the utmost respect for how you unflinchingly put
everything you have into your work, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Watching you go about your farm work with happiness
on your face and peace in your heart makes me feel
happy as well.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1475">But if you are pushing yourself to the point of collapse,
I can't turn a blind eye.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Please. Starting tomorrow, set aside your work and
focus on your recovery instead.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Can you promise me that you will?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1476">Farmers don't get sick days.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1477">I'll try not to worry you.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1478">Your honesty is one of your best qualities,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But at this moment, I would really rather you promise to
take care of yourself.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
After all...I'm worried for you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1479">...Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Knowing you, I was afraid you might say something like
"farmers don't get sick days."&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1480">As long as you understand, all is well.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1481">Now, allow me to fetch that hot milk and porridge
for you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1482">Wait a moment...what in Mother Nature's name
am I saying?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I dislike the idea of binding others or being bound myself,
yet here I am insisting he make a promise to me?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Goodness. Can being in love truly change a person this
much?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1484">This is so very out of character for me. What has gotten
into me, I wonder...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1485">Yes, this seems like a quiet enough spot.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Ms. Lillia informed me of the blue feather's significance.
According to her...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...they are customarily presented in this town to signify
a marriage proposal.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Do you mean it?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1487">I see.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Ah, please don't misunderstand. I'm elated, to say the
least. I have long dreamed of you proposing to me.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If I'm together with you, I know we will achieve happiness
in all aspects of our new life as a family.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Mother Nature Herself will bless us with Her radiant
energy. Of that I'm sure.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

  <Entry Index="1491">Personally, I wouldn't mind a private ceremony between
just the two of us...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But it would be nice to receive the blessings and goodwill
of our friends and loved ones.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'll go and inform the mayor.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1492">Aah, so it's wedding bells for the two of you? Wonderful!
Congratulations to you both!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1494">I had always imagined you as a free and independent
spirit blowing through life without a care in the world,
Jennifer.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But it seems you have found a place to call home at last.
I'm glad for you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1495">Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Mr. Harris.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's likely I will continue to spend much of my time on the
mountain, so...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1496">If you happen to see me on one of your patrols, I'd like it
if you would come chat with me as you always have.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1497">Of course! &lt;playername&gt;'s house is close to the
mountain, too, conveniently enough.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1498">That it is.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1499">Now, you two leave all the arrangements for the wedding
ceremony to me.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I will see to it that a proper venue is reserved and all the
invitations are sent.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Considering all the preparations that need to be made,
I imagine the ceremony will be in about a week or so.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

first, but it turned out to be a pleasantly dignified affair.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It has even given me some inspiration.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

of all those people...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

us well.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And now...we really are married, aren't we?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1513">Oh, I have an idea. How about we give each other new
nicknames?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I've always fancied the idea of having special names that
only we use. What do you think?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1514">So it shall be. From now on, you're my darling
&lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1515">You would like me to call you something else, hm? Such as?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1517">Everything will be fine. I'll keep working, and I'll still come

Yu, you'd better behave so that you don't make trouble
for Grandma.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1518">And so, I bid you farewell. Until we meet again.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1519">You may now exchange your rings.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1520">I always use herbs and leaves that I have picked myself
in my teas.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I drew the water from the river nearby, so I guess you
could say this tea is entirely of the mountain's bounty.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1521">To me, happiness is attuning with nature and spending

the while.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
