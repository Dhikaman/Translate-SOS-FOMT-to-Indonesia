Fortunately, it seems to be a simple case of fatigue from
overexertion.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You mustn't push yourself so hard. If you feel tired, rest.
You will spend the rest of today doing just that.
Doctor's orders.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="219">You mustn't push yourself so hard. If you feel tired, rest.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You will spend the rest of today doing just that.

  <Entry Index="220">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;. Hello, sweetie. I'm afraid I'm not
feeling very well today.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
We've had to close the store so I can rest. I'm terribly
sorry for the inconvenience.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="221">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;. Hello, sweetie. I'm afraid I'm not
feeling very well today.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
We've had to close the store so I can rest. I'm terribly
sorry for the inconvenience.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="222">Hm? Rick and Popuri? Come to think of it, both of them
left in an awful hurry. I wonder what they're up to.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="223">*huff* *huff* *huff*&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="224">Goodness, Rick. What ever is the matter? You're all out
of breath.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="225">You were just so pale, Mom, that I ran over to the Clinic
and brought some medicine back for you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="226">Oh, you did? How sweet of you! Thank you, Rick.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="227">*pant* *pant* *pant* Mamaaaaa! I got medicine!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="228">What, you went out to buy medicine too?
&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="229">"Too"? So you mean you also went out and got medicine?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="230">No, no, sweetie. It's all right. I'm so happy you two cared
so much about me that you both got medicine.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'll take both of them and get better extra fast!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="231">Okay!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="232">NOT USED</Entry>
  <Entry Index="233">Mom has never had the best health. Popuri and I do our
best to help out and take care of her.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="234">I hope we can find a way to cure Mom's condition soon.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="235">Mama's always so sick. I worry a lot about her.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="236">Aww. I guess we have an extra one we don't need, then.
I'm sorry, Mama. I wasted our money...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="237">Rick and Popuri are such sweet children. I'm so proud of
them. I have to hurry and get better for their sakes.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="238">Oh! Well hello, &lt;playername&gt;.
Isn't today just wonderful?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="239">Oh! Well hello, &lt;playername&gt;.
Isn't today just wonderful?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="240">Oh, hey. Welcome.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="241">Hiya, &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="242">&lt;nickname&gt;, you came!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="243">Hm? I seem to be in a good mood today?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
*giggle* Oh yes, I am. Very much so. Today has really
raised my spirits. Can you guess why?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="244">Well, you see...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I received a letter from my husband today! It's the first
one I've ever gotten from him. I'm sooooo happy!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="245">You're curious about what it says, aren't you?
I'll go ahead and read it for you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="246">Ahem.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
"Dear Lillia. How are Rick and Popuri? I'm fine.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Right now, I'm searching through the desert to find the
flower that can heal your condition.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Finding one small flower in this huge desert will be hard,
but I do this for you. I'm sure I'll find it some day.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Until then, please wait for me. Take care of the store
until I return."&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="247">Oh, isn't my husband just so caring and wonderful?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="248">Hmph. "Take care of the store," he says. Like it's
that easy. We're caring for a whole bunch of animals,
you know!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="249">Geez, Rick. Can't you just admit you're happy to hear
from him?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="250">If he could send a letter, that means he's safe and okay,
right? Oh, that makes me feel so much better!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="251">I'd rather he just come home and tell us HIMSELF
instead of writing a letter.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="252">Mama looks super happy! I'm super happy too!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="253">Hum dum da da da~ ♪ La la taa taa taa~ ♪ Oh, I am so
happy today!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="254">Uh... Can I help you?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="255">You know what this is about. It's been a long time coming,
but--KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF MY SISTER!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="256">Huh? What the heck are you on about?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="257">Don't try to deny it! I know she comes here all the time
to see you!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="258">Dude, I haven't done anything. Popuri comes here because
she wants to.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="259">No way! I just know you've got to be tricking her into
coming here!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="260">Why the heck would I do that? Nothing like that is going
on at all.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="261">Geez. I feel sorry for Popuri if she's stuck with such a
blockhead for a brother.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="262">WHAT DID YOU CALL ME?!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Don't you ever go anywhere near my sister again or else!
Got it?!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="263">Sorry, dude. Can't promise you that. Even if I don't go see
her, don'tcha think she'll still come and see me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="264">HMPH! Just stay away from her, you hear? I mean it!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="299">Hi, Mr. Zack. Hi, &lt;playername&gt;. I didn't know you'd
be here.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="300">Hi, Mr. Zack. Hi, &lt;nickname&gt;. I didn't know you'd
be here.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="301">Mr. Zack, is my delivery here yet?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="302">Yep! Sure is! This is it right here.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="303">Ah! Great!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="304">Took a lotta work t'get this, y'know. Hope it turns out
good for ya.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="305">Thanks! Oh, and don't tell Mama, okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="306">You betcha. I can already see the happy look on her face
when she gets a load of that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="307">Me too. I can't wait!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="308">Hm? You're surprised to see me here?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="309">Well, yeah. We usually have Mr. Zack deliver our orders
to the store, but I wanted to keep this one a secret.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
That's why I asked him to hold this one here instead.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="310">What did I buy? Um... Do you promise not to tell anyone?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="311">What did I buy? Um... Do you promise not to tell anyone?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="312">My lips are sealed.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="313">No promises.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="314">Really? You won't tell aaaaanybody? Well, all right, then.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="315">See, um, Mama's birthday is coming up. I wanna surprise
her, but if I buy a present from town, everyone'll know
what it is.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
So I decided I'd order one for her instead!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="316">Yep! And it just came in. Don't ya breathe a word of this
to Lillia, y'hear?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="317">Fine. Then I won't tell you. I'm not gonna share secrets
with someone who can't keep them.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="318">Girl's got a point. Nobody likes a blabbermouth, y'know.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="319">Anyway, I'm gonna head home and hide this. Thanks a lot,
Mr. Zack!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="320">No prob! You keep that safe an' outta sight till the big
day, yeah?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="321">I will!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="322">Man, she sure grew up into a sweet kid who loves her ma.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="323">It's me. How are you doing? ...Hmm.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="324">So you're not coming back? ...I see. All right.
I'll call you later.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="325">Was that Joanna?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="326">Yes...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Mei's been waiting patiently for her, but it's been so long
and she still won't come home.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="327">I'm sure Joanna's got her reasons.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="328">What could possibly be more important than your own
flesh and blood? Poor Mei. It breaks my old heart to see
her like this.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="329">Now that you mention it, the last time she showed her
face here she just dropped Mei in your lap.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And then she was off again...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="330">She's always been like that. No matter what happened,
she'd keep it all to herself to keep me from worrying.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="331">But this time... This time I can't forgive her. Leaving her
own daughter here without a word as to why.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Mei tries to keep her chin up, but sometimes she just
looks so lonely.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
She probably misses her mother. And when I see her
like that, I just can't bear it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="332">Mei's still at the age where she needs her mom, after all.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="333">Every time I call Joanna I tell her she needs to
come back.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But she always says she has things she needs to do
and won't listen to a word I say.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="334">Well, then... I guess I'll make Mei's favorite food today.
Sorry for talking your ear off. If you'll excuse me...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="335">It's me. Are you still doing all right?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I brought Mei today. She said she wanted to talk to
you too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="336">I'm giving the phone to her now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="337">Mommy? It's me, Mei.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="338">Yep... Okay. I do everything Grandpa says, promise.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Uh-huh. Yeah...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="339">Oh! Didja know a guy came to take care of that farm in
town?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Yeah... He's super cool! You should come back too, Mommy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="340">Oh! Didja know a lady came to take care of that farm in
town?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Yeah... She's super cool! You should come back too,
Mommy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="341">Oh... Okay... You can't come back yet, huh?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Yeah, you don't hafta worry about me. I'm giving the
phone back to Grandpa now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="342">It's me again. ...Oh. I see.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Okay. I'll call again later.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="343">Were you talking to Joanna?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="344">Yep! I sure was! It's been a long time... I'm so happy I got
to talk to her!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="345">Well that's just great. Good for you, Mei!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="346">Yep!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="347">But...she said she can't come back yet.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="348">Oh yeah? That's...a bit disappointing, huh?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="349">Come on, Mei... Let's go home. Sorry for the bother,
Dudley.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="350">Bye-bye!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="351">Goodbye, Mei.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="352">Hey there. Sorry to intrude on such a rainy day.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="353">Oh, don't you worry one bit, dear.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="354">I'm so glad you came over for a visit, Sai.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="355">Indeed, here I am. Ho ho ho ho ho!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="356">Eh? And if it isn't &lt;playername&gt;. How long've you
been there?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="357">He's been there this whooooole time.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="358">She's been there this whooooole time.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="359">Hrm. Is that so?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Well, I think I'll be going now. Good day, Ellen.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="360">Oh no. What ever is the matter, Sai? Your face is redder
than a beet.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="361">Thanks for stopping by, Sai.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="362">Hi, Mr. Saibara!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="363">Hello, Ellen. Yu. I just happened to be in the area,
so I thought I'd drop by.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="364">Oh, you're always welcome, Sai.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="365">If these legs of mine would just work the way they
used to, I'd pay you a little visit too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="366">...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="367">But as it is, I can't go out and about like I did before.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="368">It seems like forever ago that you and I used to go to
the valley, the beach, the mountain...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Oh, how I miss those days. There's no way I could do
that now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="369">Don't say that! I'm sure you'll get better.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And when you do, we'll go see the cherry blossoms
together in spring.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="370">Oh, Sai. You're so sweet. Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="371">No, no... It's nothing. W-Well, then. I'll be going.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="372">...Eh?! W-Well if it isn't &lt;playername&gt;! What are you
doing over there?! You here on b-business?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="373">Um, Mr. Saibara... This is Grandma's house, remember?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="374">O-Oh... Yes. Yes, of course. Well, then. If you'll excuse me...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="375">Mr. Saibara's so weird!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="376">Well, let's dig in, then.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="377">Yeah, sure. Go ahead and try this... And this too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="378">Huh. Pretty good.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="379">Right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="380">Oh hey, &lt;playername&gt;. Welcome.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="381">Oh hey, &lt;nickname&gt;. Welcome.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="382">Yo, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="383">Yo, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="384">Yo, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="385">What? You think it's weird for me to be at Kai's Cafe
or somethin'?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Well, I was invited way back, so I came.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="386">Yep! I wanna get to know what the food scene is like
in this town a bit better.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And Gray's the only one I know well enough in town
to ask.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
So I'm making him try out my new menu and grilling
him 'bout what he thinks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="387">Well, I dunno much about cooking, but I know good food
when I taste it, and his stuff is good.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="388">Thanks, man! Hearing that makes it all worthwhile.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="389">If I hang around too long, though, I'll get an earful
from Grandpa. I better head back.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="390">Yeah, sorry for taking up so much time. I know you're
super busy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="391">See ya.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="392">See you later. You too, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="393">See you later. You too, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="394">See you later. You too, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="395">Gray's a good guy. We get along real well.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="396">He and I talk a lot at the Inn. This is the first time
he's been to my place, though.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="397">While you're here, why not try out my menu too?
I can whip you up something delicious, I promise!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="398">Good morning, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="399">We'll be harvesting the grapes at the Vineyard
tomorrow. Would you lend a hand?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I will, of course, pay you for the trouble.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="400">Sure!</Entry>
  <Entry Index="401">Sorry, too busy.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="402">Thanks. I appreciate it.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Check in with Manna at the house
at 10:00 AM, then.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="403">Oh, and if you know anyone else who could help,
please invite them.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Say, how about asking that young man who is always
hanging around the Church?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It'll be easier the more people we have.
I'm counting on you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="404">Yes, of course. I understand. You have your own work
to do.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Well, if you know anyone else who might be able to help,
tell them about it, would you?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Say, how about asking that young man who is always
hanging around the Church?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And if you change your mind, feel free to come on over.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="405">We'd like your help until 5:00 PM. Is that okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="406">Help</Entry>
  <Entry Index="407">Pass</Entry>
  <Entry Index="408">Hmm. You won't be able to do the job with your hands full.
Please put that away somewhere.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="409">All right! Happy picking!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="410">I'm expecting a good day's work out of you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="411">I expect a good day's work out of the pair of you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="412">I'll do my best.
&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="413">Well done. Here's your pay. You were a great help today.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="414">Thank you for all your hard work. I'm sure you must be
quite thirsty now. Feel free to grab a drink.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="415">The fruits of your labor are going to make quite
the vintage. Look forward to it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="416">Oh yes, Cliff. If you've not got other work lined up,
how about sticking around to help out at the Vineyard?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The harvest may be over, but we've got plenty of other
things to do like processing the grapes and tending to
the vines.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="417">Are you sure? Do you really think I can help?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="418">We talked it over together. Our daughter has left town,
so it's just the two of us at the Vineyard now. An extra
pair of hands would be a lifesaver.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="419">You're a hard worker, Cliff, and you're good with
your hands.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="420">Yes! We'd be more than happy if you'd stay on.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="421">I... Thank you. I'll do my best to be of service to you both.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="422">This is all because you invited me to help,
&lt;playername&gt;. Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="423">This is all because you invited me to help,
&lt;playername&gt;. Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="424">There's no need to apologize. I know you have your
own work. I'll just do what I can.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="426">Well, I'd better get back to the farm, then.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="427">There's no need to apologize. You did bring Cliff to help,
after all.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="432">Dear! You've been drinking behind my back again,
haven't you?!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="433">I haven't had a single drop.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="434">Don't you lie to me! What's this empty bottle under
our bed, then?! This isn't from our Vineyard!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="435">Urgh...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="436">I...I was just doing some research to see how we stack up
against the competition!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="437">Oooh, research, is it? Why is this "research" being
conducted while I sleep?!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="438">Oh, quit your nagging, woman! I can have a few drinks
if I want!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="439">Enough! Didn't you say you weren't going to drink
anymore?! Try keeping your promises for once!
As it is, you can't stop once you've started,
and who is it that has to deal with you?! Me!
Do you know how much Adge hated to see you like that?
Even if she came back, she'd take one look at you
and leave again! And Cliff will, too. I won't forgive you
if we lose such a nice boy because of your nasty habits!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="440">...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="441">I've never said that you aren't allowed to drink ever
again. Even if I did, it would be impossible for
you anyway. But could you at least try to cut back?
I'm worried about your health too, you know...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="442">Okay...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="443">All right, then. I'll let you off the hook for today.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="444">Sorry you had to see that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="445">I'm so sorry, &lt;playername&gt;. Here you came to visit
only to find us fighting with each other.
Please don't let it upset you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="446">Welcome.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="447">Oh, if it isn't &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="448">Out for a bit of shopping, are we?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Oh, me? I came by to chat with Sasha and thought I'd
grab a few odds and ends while I was at it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="449">What are you picking up today?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Ah, undecided still, huh? Well me, I'm buying things
for supper.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="450">So...I think I'll take some onigiri and curry powder, please.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="451">Onigiri and curry powder. Coming right up.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="452">My, my. Jeff, is it my imagination or have you gotten
smoother?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="453">Uh...?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="454">Yes! There it is! There's no doubt about it.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I don't stop by for a few days and you suddenly become...
How should I put it? More assertive? More manly?&lt;wait&gt; </Entry>
  <Entry Index="455">Oh...do you think so?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="456">Oh my, yes. The way you rattled off my list was just so
confident and bold. So...how much does that all come to?&lt;wait&gt; </Entry>
  <Entry Index="457">Oh, um... Well, I can give you a discount. H-Half off?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="458">You're sure?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
How gentlemanly! My husband could certainly learn
a thing or two from you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="459">No, no. You're embarrassing me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="460">That's the secret to shopping here, you know. Shower
Jeff with compliments and you'll be swimming in
discounts. Tee hee!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="461">Manna has such a way with words.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="462">Oh, Jeff. So soft and pliable.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="463">Hmmm...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="464">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;. *sigh*&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="465">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;. *sigh*&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="466">You want to know what's wrong? Well, truth be told...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It seems that someone read one of my books--the one
about mushrooms, to be precise--and they...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Well, it seems they misunderstood it. Apparently,
they ate a poisonous mushroom by mistake.&lt;wait&gt;
</Entry>
  <Entry Index="467">And that person sent me an angry letter about it.
I don't quite know how to reply.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
What do you think?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="468">Explain their mistake.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="469">Apologize to them.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="470">Yes... Yes, you're right.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If the reader has misunderstood, it's my duty to explain
their error.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="471">Thank you, &lt;playername&gt;. I feel much better now.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I think I'll go ahead and write my reply.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="472">Thank you, &lt;playername&gt;. I feel much better now.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I think I'll go ahead and write my reply.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="473">I...see. You think so?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Perhaps I didn't write it correctly. I confess I've lost
a bit of confidence in myself.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Could you leave me alone for now?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="474">I think I'll write that reply now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="475">Thanks to you, I know the right way to interact with
my readers. Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="498">Hello, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="499">You want to know what we're doing?
Desserts! Anna was just teaching me how to make all
kinds of sweet treats. She's quite the accomplished cook,
you know.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="500">Oh no, not at all. You're embarrassing me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="501">Ah, that's right! You spend a bit of time in the kitchen
on occasion, don't you, &lt;playername&gt;?
Why don't you take some dessert lessons from Anna
as well?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="502">Yes, please!</Entry>
  <Entry Index="503">Sorry, too busy.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="504">Oh really? All right, then. I'm happy to share my recipes.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="505">Okay, you two. Listen carefully.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
We'll start with a simple Cake.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The main ingredients are Eggs, Wheat Flour, and Butter.
And Seasoning, of course.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Combine and bake, then let cool. Once it's not too hot,
spread creamy frosting on top, and ta-dah! It's done!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Easy, right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="506">I think I've got it. Any other tips or recipes you can share
with us?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="507">Hmmm... I do have more, but won't it be hard to remember
so much at once?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Oh! Wait! I have an idea. Why not come by at this time
every Saturday, and I'll give you a lesson?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="508">Really? What a wonderful idea!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="509">Yes. Be sure to drop by. I'll teach you all my best recipes
if you do.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="510">Great! You should come by too, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="511">Awww... Please don't be like that. Everyone needs to
know how to cook.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="512">Awww... Please don't be like that. Everyone needs to
know how to cook.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="513">Yes, but I understand. &lt;playername&gt; is busy with the
farm. I guess there just isn't enough time for this sort
of thing.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="514">True... Farms DO take a lot of work.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="515">Well then, what would you like me to teach you, Manna?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="516">Hmmm... My sponge cake always turns into a "brick cake."
Could you teach me how to make those?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="517">All right. Sponge cake it is...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="518">Well, now that all my students are here, let us begin
the lesson.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="519">Yes, Mrs. Anna. Please start. Hee hee...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="520">Now pay attention, class. Hee hee...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="521">Let's see... How about I teach you how to make
Cookies today?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Everybody loves cookies, from the youngest of the young
to the oldest of the old.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The ingredients you need are an Egg, Wheat Flour,
and Butter. You'll also need a Rolling Pin, Oven,
and Seasoning.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Not too difficult, right? Now you'll have just the thing
for your sweetheart on a special day.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="522">Thank you very much, Mrs. Anna.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="523">You're very welcome. Well then, I'll see you at the
next lesson.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="524">For today's lesson, how about...Pudding? It's popular
among both children and adults.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You'll need an Egg and some Milk. And also a Pot, Oven,
and Seasoning.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The main ingredients are all very simple, which makes
this quite the easy recipe, don't you think?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="525">Let's see... Why don't we learn about Cheesecake today?
Its subtle flavor is very popular with adults.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You'll need Cheese, an Egg, and Milk. You'll also need
a Pot, Whisk, Oven, and Seasoning.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Remember that its charm is in its mellow flavor,
so don't go crazy with the seasoning!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="526">For today...how about Apple Pie?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's one of Ellen's favorites, you know.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You'll need an Apple, Egg, Wheat Flour, Butter, Knife,
Pot, Rolling Pin, and an Oven.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Oh, and Seasoning, of course. Making the dough can be
a bit tricky, but the results are well worth it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="527">Oh no, you're very welcome. I think our next lesson will be
our last, though.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="528">Awww, really?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="529">Yes, I'm afraid so. Basil has started work on his next
book, so he'll need silence to focus.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="530">I suppose there's nothing we can do, then.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="531">I'm very sorry.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="532">Well then, for our last lesson I'll teach you how to make
Ice Cream. A cold treat, perfect for summertime.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You'll need Milk, an Egg, and Seasoning. Plus a Pot and
a Whisk.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Children absolutely adore ice cream.
Me too, if I'm honest!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="533">And with that...class is dismissed!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="534">Oh no, you're very welcome. I had a lot of fun
teaching you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="552">Oh? Hello, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="553">Settled into married life yet? I'm sure it's quite the
change, but do your best.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="554">Mm? What am I doing?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm looking for plants for Papa to use in his research.
He's working hard, so I want to do what I can to help him.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="555">How thoughtful!</Entry>
  <Entry Index="556">As you should.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="557">It's nothing, really.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's something I've always done. I'm a little embarrassed
to be praised for it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="558">Oh, I apologize for detaining you. I'll be heading back
home now.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I hope your work goes well too, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="559">Yes, you're right. We're able to make a living because
of Papa's hard work.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If I could just get married, that would ease his burden
a little, though...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="560">Good morning to you, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="561">Am I right in assuming this is the first time you've ever
worked on a farm? Please allow me to offer some advice.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
To talk to a person standing in front of you or lift objects
next to you, press the Confirm Button.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Next, to use an item, make certain to equip it first, then
press the Tool Button to use it.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And when you need to do a bit of shopping, go to a store,
stand across the counter from the shopkeeper and talk
to them. However...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If the store is closed, you can still speak to the
shopkeeper, but you won't be able to buy anything.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="562">There are several other controls available to you, as well.
Would you like for me to explain them too?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="563">All right. What would you like to know more about?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="564">Raising Crops</Entry>
  <Entry Index="565">Tending Livestock</Entry>
  <Entry Index="566">Handy Options</Entry>
  <Entry Index="567">I'm good, thanks.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="568">Are you sure? You needn't be so shy.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
All right. If you insist.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If you ever have a question or feel confused about
anything, you can look it up by examining the Bookshelf
in your home.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="569">This is your farm, after all. You may do with it as
you wish.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Though, may I recommend focusing on earning a little
money first to make life a touch easier?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
There are many things in the forest that you can forage
and ship for a little pocket change, for example.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="570">And once your daily chores are finished, I suggest taking
a stroll about town and meeting the local residents.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If you follow the road from your farm to the right,
you will find your neighbors. I'm sure they'd be happy
to chat or give advice.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="571">Oh yes. One last thing. When you return home, check your
Tool Box. Inside you'll find a little gift.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's just my old Pedometer, but I think you'll get some use
out of it.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Mineral Town is a large place, after all. It might be
interesting to see how many steps you've walked.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="572">Now then, that ought to do for today. I'll drop by to see
how you're doing again soon. Good luck!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="573">Yo! I'm Zack. I handle all the shippin' 'round these parts.
Nice t'meet ya!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
When you're farmin', there's one big thing ya gotta
remember, yeah?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Here. I'll show ya.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="574">See this? This is your Shipping Bin. Don't forget about it.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Ya wanna sell somethin'? Ya put it in the Bin. I come by
at 5:00 PM every day an' pick up whatever's in there.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
When I do, I'll automatically add your cut of the sale
t'your wallet. Nifty, right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="575">Oh, but I don't come by t'collect on holidays or festival
days. Ya wanna know why?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
'CUZ I WANT DAYS OFF TOO, DARN IT!
HYAHAHAHAHAHA!!!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="576">Ah...ha ha...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="577">Anyway. This ain't your only Shipping Bin. There's one
inside the Coop an' Barn, too!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="578">Ya can sell crops you've harvested or stuff ya foraged
from the mountain.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Oh, an' stuff like Eggs, Milk, an' Wool can go in there too.
Ya get the idea, right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="579">Okay, now listen up. This is important. Workin' hard
is great an' all, but don't overdo it.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If your face starts goin' blue, that's a sign you're about
t'keel over.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
When ya get that bad, don't push it. Just go an' rest,
all right? Nobody wants a vacation to the Clinic.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="580">Got all that? Good. I'll be stoppin' by at 5:00 PM, then.
See ya.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="581">&lt;playername&gt;. I've come with a request that I can
only entrust to someone discreet and of good character.
I believe that someone is you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="582">Oh yes. That's right. You are a young lady. I knew that.
Anyway, I would still like to request this of you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

town and I got into...erm, a "spirited discussion,"
shall we say.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
To make a long story short, I am now required to deliver
"Mochi" to them no later than today.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I would like you to procure that item for me. I can trust
no one but you with this critical task.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="594">Please! My good reputation rests upon this!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="595">Well? You will accept, won't you?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="596">Of course!</Entry>
  <Entry Index="597">No can do.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="598">You will? Oh, I just knew I could count on you,
&lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Now then, I have other business to attend to and won't
be back till later this evening.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I will come by to retrieve the item at 7:00 PM.
Please have it ready by then. I'm relying on
you, &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="599">I... I see. How unfortunate.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It seems I misjudged you, &lt;playername&gt;. Ah well.
I will simply have to manage by myself, then.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="600">Good evening, &lt;playername&gt;. Were you able to get
the item? If I may see it...?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="601">No, no. This isn't it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="602">I asked you to get a Diamond. Please hurry and bring one
to me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="603">I asked you to get a Bracelet. Please hurry and bring one
to me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="604">I asked you to get a Green Pepper. Please hurry and
bring one to me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="605">I asked you to get a Golden Egg. Please hurry and bring
one to me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="606">I asked you to get Black Grass. Please hurry and bring
one to me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="607">I asked you to get White Grass. Please hurry and bring
one to me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="608">I asked you to get a Matsutake. Please hurry and bring
one to me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="609">I asked you to get a Moonstone. Please hurry and bring
one to me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="610">I asked you to get an AEPFE Apple. Please hurry and
bring one to me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="611">I asked you to get Mochi. Please hurry and bring one
to me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="612">Aha! Yes! This is exactly it!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I knew coming to you was the correct choice!
Now, let me hurry to our lovely neighbors
and show off--AHEM.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Anyway. Here. Please accept this as a token of my
eternal gratitude.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="613">This is called Golden Lumber. It is a highly valuable
building material.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Some years ago, using this to decorate outside your house
was frowned upon as a shameless display of opulence... &lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But no one pays it much mind these days. This lumber
won't rot in the rain, so if you'd like, you can make a
fence of it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="614">Now then, I must be on my way...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="615">Oh, so close! That IS a diamond, yes, but I don't require
one with any color.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Please bring me just a plain, regular Diamond.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="616">Yes, this is jewelry that Mr. Saibara made, but it isn't
quite what I requested.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If you could, please bring me a Bracelet.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="617">Unfortunately, this is not quite the egg I was looking for.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Could you please bring me a Golden Egg?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="618">...A cooked egg. I see you have a ripe sense of humor.
However...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I need a Golden Egg, please. Uncooked and still in its shell!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="619">I'm afraid this is not the right color of grass.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="620">Please bring me Black Grass.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="621">Please bring me White Grass.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="622">Yes, there IS Matsutake in this, but I never said anything
about a meal!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I need a regular Matsutake, raw and uncooked,
if you please!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="623">No, no, no. This isn't the right type of mushroom at all!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Please bring me a Matsutake. Ma-tsu-ta-ke!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="624">No, no. If all I needed was a regular Apple, this wouldn't
be nearly so difficult!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Please bring me an AEPFE Apple.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="625">Oh, so close! But I'm afraid this isn't quite the apple
I'm looking for.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Please bring me an AEPFE Apple.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="626">Who asked for cooked apples?!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Please bring me an AEPFE Apple, raw and uncooked!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="627">No, no, no. I don't need it to be cooked. Please bring me
regular, uncooked Mochi.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="628">I'm terribly sorry to disturb you at this hour, but do you
have a moment? I'd like to ask for your advice on
something.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="629">I'm all ears.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="630">Sorry, I'm busy.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="631">I will get straight to the point. Have you heard of Adge,
Duke and Manna's daughter? Well, I love her.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="632">I would like to send her a letter, but I feel rather
awkward writing to her out of the blue.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="633">That is when I remembered that you married the person
you fell in love with, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Given your experience with love and relationships,
I thought you might have some advice for someone
in my position.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Do you have any suggestions for what I should do?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="634">Tell her how you feel.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="635">Think it over yourself.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="636">Hmm. I see. You might have a point there. Going back and
forth over it in my head will hardly get me anywhere,
after all.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="637">Hmm. I see. You might have a point there. Going back and
forth over it in my head will hardly get me anywhere,
after all.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'll do it, then. I'll write Adge a letter telling her exactly
how I feel.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Thank you, &lt;playername&gt;. That was just the push
I needed.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="638">...I see. I apologize for bothering you. Please excuse me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="639">Ah, I see. I apologize for bothering you. Well then, I'll take
my leave. Be well.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="640">I'm sorry to bother you at this hour...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="641">Hm? I look down, you say? *sigh*&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I am rather depressed, actually. You see, the other day
I wrote a letter to Adge explaining my feelings for her.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Today I received her reply.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="642">It seems she has feelings for someone in the city where
she's living now.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Ah ha ha... I guess that's it, then.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="643">No, no. Please don't worry about it.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
In fact, I'm really grateful for the advice you gave me.
It was spot on.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
By writing Adge that letter I was able to tell her how
I felt and hear her answer.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It may not have been the answer I wanted,
but it is what it is. I can move on now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="644">Considering you were the one who advised me, I thought
it only right to let you know how it went.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="645">Well then, stay safe and take care.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="646">&lt;playername&gt;, welcome.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="647">Basil will be visiting today.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="648">Oh, welcome, Basil.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="649">Hello there, Ellen. Thank you for having me over today.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Greetings, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="650">Hello there, Ellen. Thank you for having me over today.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Greetings, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="651">I came by to ask Ellen about a certain extraordinary
plant. Would you like to hear about it too?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="652">I came by to ask Ellen about a certain extraordinary
plant. Would you like to hear about it too?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="653">All right, then. Let's listen together.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="654">Okay, Ellen. Would you tell us what you know?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="655">Certainly. Now, this was long before you two were born,
but...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's said that on summer nights a pure white flower can
be found blooming under the moonlight.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="656">The flower is called the Night-Blooming Cereus, and the
ones who saw it aren't around anymore.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But I'd like to see it once myself before I die.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="657">The Night-Blooming Cereus... That's something I wouldn't
mind seeing myself.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="658">&lt;playername&gt;. If you find that flower, could you
bring it to Ellen?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'll be looking for it too, of course.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="659">&lt;playername&gt;. If you find that flower, could you
bring it to Ellen?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'll be looking for it too, of course.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="660">All right, I'm going to do some research on it at my house.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="661">I wish I could see it. Just once...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="662">But maybe my dream will never come true...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="663">Is this the Night-Blooming Cereus that Ellen mentioned?
In any case, I should try bringing it to her.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="664">Ah! That flower! Could it be...&lt;wait&gt;
</Entry>
  <Entry Index="665">Wow! It sure is pretty.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="666">Th-That flower! How did you...?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="667">It's so beautiful. So this is the Night-Blooming Cereus.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="668">Where did you find it, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Hmm? At the mountain summit? So that's where it was...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="669">Where did you find it, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Hmm? At the mountain summit? So that's where it was...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="670">Thank you, &lt;playername&gt;. I'll treasure it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="671">Ellen's really happy!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="672">Ellen's really happy!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="673">&lt;playername&gt;, welcome.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="674">&lt;playername&gt;, welcome.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="675">Yaaay! It's &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="676">Yaaay! It's &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="677">Thank you for coming. Please make yourself at home.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="678">How's work on the farm coming along? Is it keeping
you busy?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="679">Farming takes a lot of dedication and has many
responsibilities. I think &lt;playername&gt; is doing
a fine job.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="680">It sounds like I could learn a thing or two from you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="681">You're doing a fine job too, Elly. Even on your day off
you're studying that book from the doctor.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="682">Yeah!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="683">Oh, but that's nothing, really.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="684">Ah! That's right. Speaking of books, I forgot to return
another one I'd borrowed from the doctor.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm sure it was on this shelf...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="685">Yes, there it is.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'll be returning this...oh.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="686">What's the matter, dear?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="687">When I took out the book, something fell down. It looks
like a letter.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's addressed to you, Grandma.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="688">Hmmm? A letter for me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="689">Gracious me, this is from Grandpa!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="690">From Grandpa?
&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="691">What does it say?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="692">Just hold your horses a moment. I'll read it aloud.
Let's see here...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="693">"To my dearest Ellen, I'm writing this letter on the day
our wonderful granddaughter Elly was born.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm a grandpa now. I couldn't possibly be any happier.
I'm so glad I met you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Thank you for everything.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I wonder when you'll read this letter? I'm too
embarrassed to give it to you, so I'm hiding it.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If you do end up reading this, just treasure it in your
heart...like I treasure you."&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="694">So he wrote that all those years ago. Oh, Grandpa...
He should have just given it to you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="695">Your grandpa always was a shy one.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I had no idea he'd written such a thing.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's almost like he sent it from heaven. I'll have to put this
somewhere safe.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="696">It's just like him to hide something in a place like that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="697">He was terribly bashful, you know. Hahaha.&lt;wait&gt;
</Entry>
  <Entry Index="698">I never knew Grandpa was that shy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="699">I'm so glad we found that. Grandma looks over the moon.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="700">Grandpa, huh? I wish I coulda met him.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="701">Oh my. Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Ah, I'll use this Wool to make you a Stocking to put
presents in for Starlight Night. I'll have it done in just
a jiffy!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="702">Whoa! Ellen's knitting is lightning-fast!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="703">And here you are!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="704">Phew... That tuckered me out.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="705">I'm glad you like it. I'll have Yu bring it over to your
house later.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="706">I should hang that Stocking up on the wall.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="707">Hee hee hee! Grandmaaa!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="708">Oh? What now?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="709">Wouldja read me a book?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="710">Yes, of course.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="711">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="712">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="713">Ah, &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="714">Ah, &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="715">Deary me, welcome. I've not seen Yu so excited in ages.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
He really seems to think of you like an older brother.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="716">Deary me, welcome. I've not seen Yu so excited in ages.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
He really seems to think of you like an older sister.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="717">C'mon, let's play!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="718">C'mon, let's play!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="719">I'm game.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="720">I'm busy!</Entry>
  <Entry Index="721">Yu, come now. &lt;playername&gt; is probably very busy.
Are you sure you have the time?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="722">Yu, come now. &lt;playername&gt; is probably very busy.
Are you sure you have the time?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="723">Yaaay!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="724">C'mon, let's play s'more!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="725">C'mon, let's play s'more!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="726">Yu, isn't that enough? I'm sure &lt;playername&gt; has lots
of work to do.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="727">Yu, isn't that enough? I'm sure &lt;playername&gt; has lots
of work to do.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="728">Yeah... Okay.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="729">You should thank &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="730">Thanks, &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="731">Thanks, &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="732">Thank you for spending some time with Yu.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="733">You're welcome here any time.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="734">*sniffle* Waaah!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="735">What were you expecting? &lt;playername&gt; has a lot of
work to do!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="736">What were you expecting? &lt;playername&gt; has a lot of
work to do!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="737">But... But... Waaaaaaah!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="738">I'll console him, so could you leave now?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="739">Sorry.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="740">Hello, there. Welcome! Come on in!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="741">Hello, &lt;playername&gt;. Welcome.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="742">How goes the farm? If you need anything, feel free
to ask.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="743">Yes, please do. We're not just saying this to be polite.
If you need any help, tell us.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="744">Excuse me. Is anybody here?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="745">Goodness, who could that be? Excuse me. I'll be back in
just a moment.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="746">Huh. Wonder who that is.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="747">Dear, it seems you have a customer.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="748">Hello. You are the proprietor of this store, yes?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="749">I am. And you are?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="750">I am Huang, a traveling merchant. It is nice to meet you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="751">It's nice to meet you too. How can I help you?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="752">You make paintings, yes?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="753">Hm? Yes, I do dabble a bit. But just as a hobby, really...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="754">I happened to see one of your paintings once. It was
wonderful. So very wonderful. In fact, it moved me to
tears.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I would be honored if you would sell your paintings to me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="755">My word! I never expected anyone to want to buy my
husband's paintings. What a surprise.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="756">Madam, you are very blessed. Your husband has great
skill. I was very impressed.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="757">Why, thank you. Now, how much are you offering?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="758">Hmmm, let me see. I will pay you 10,000G for each
painting. A good deal, yes?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="759">Oh my...! Dear, I really think you ought to consider selling.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="760">Dear, I really think you ought to consider selling.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="761">...I'm sorry. I'm afraid my paintings aren't for sale.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="762">They aren't? Why not? Was my offer not enough?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="763">Dear, why ever not? I don't think you'll see a deal this
good again.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="764">Sasha, I'm sorry. But...I don't paint for money.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
When I create art, I'm taking what I find deep inside and
putting it on canvas for everyone to see.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If I ever sold those paintings... It would feel like I was
selling a piece of my heart.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="765">Dear...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="766">*sigh* I understand.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I thought my offer was strong, but it seems your will
is stronger.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I will not ask you to sell your paintings again. May you
have an auspicious day. Goodbye.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="767">Goodness, dear...I think I've fallen for you all over again.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="768">R-Really? Ahahaha...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Well, ah, I'd best get back to work, then!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="769">All right. Give it your best, dear.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="770">My, my. To think he had such conviction in him.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
How dashing.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="771">How many times do I have to tell you to STOP
DOING THAT!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="772">Eek! Oh...my ulcer...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="773">Ah, er...welcome.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="774">Hold it right there! Don't think for a second that we're
done here!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="775">Listen to this. My fool of a husband let another customer
browbeat him into selling our products on a tab again!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Dear, do you even understand what that does to us?
When you let them put it on a tab that means we get
NO MONEY!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
At this point, &lt;playername&gt; is the only one who
actually pays us anymore!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="776">Dear, do you even understand what that does to us?
When you let them put it on a tab that means we get
NO MONEY!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
At this point, &lt;playername&gt; is the only one who
actually pays us anymore!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="777">I do understand, darling, but everyone promises that
they'll pay us eventually.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="778">Of course they do. Because "eventually" never comes!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="779">Urk!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="780">*SIGH* You're unbelievable. Completely hopeless.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You're a grown man, so start acting like one!
Straighten that spine! Find some guts!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="781">The next customer that comes in had better leave us
with some money in our till or so help me I'll...!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="782">Okay, okay. I'll make sure to have our next customer pay
up front.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="783">Oh look. Someone's here. &lt;playername&gt;, come on over.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="784">Yo, Jeff.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="785">Er, h-hello there, Duke.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="786">Thought I'd duck in here to get out of the rain and do
a little shopping while I was at it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="787">I-I see. Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="788">Great! I'll take some of this and this, then. Just put it on
my tab.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="789">Um...Duke?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="790">What, Jeff?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="791">I n-need you to, erm, pay for that today. P-Please?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="792">Huh? What do you mean? I just said to put it on my tab,
didn't I?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="793">I-If you please, I really need you to pay for that today.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="794">We, er, won't be accepting anything on tab anymore!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="795">...Okay, okay. No more tab. Got it. But I don't have any
money on me right now. You can come by and grab it
later, all right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="796">O-Okay. I'll do that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="797">You did it, dear! Well done!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="798">Phew... I did, didn't I? I can hardly believe it myself.&lt;wait&gt; </Entry>
  <Entry Index="799">If you were able to stand up to Duke of all people, then
I'm sure you won't have problems with anyone else.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="800">Yes, I think I ought to be fine now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="801">I'm so proud of you, dear.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="802">Eheh heh...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="803">From now on, I think I'll be able to ask customers to pay
for what they buy up front! I think! Probably!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="804">I really hope this does the trick, and he stops letting
customers put things on a tab...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="805">If you don't mind, I'd like to ask you for some advice...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="806">Oh? Ask away.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="807">It's about Adge.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="808">Adge is your daughter, right? I've heard all about her but
not yet had the pleasure of meeting her.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="809">Yes. She got into a bit of an argument with her father
and stormed out of the house.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="810">I see...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="811">Have you heard anything from her lately?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="812">Oh, yes. She writes to me regularly, but it's all just
pleasantries and idle chat. I want to know what
she really thinks, but I doubt she'll tell me.
And I don't want to leave things as they are...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="813">Hmm, that is quite the pickle.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="814">All right. Next time I hear from her I'll ask about
it offhandedly.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
She might be more willing to open up about it to a friend
than her parents.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="815">True, true.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The more a parent harps on a point, the more stubborn
the child gets. Doing it this way will probably net better
results.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="816">Thanks, Sasha, Anna. I'm so glad I talked to you two
about this. All that confusion and anxiety I felt is gone
now. There truly isn't any greater treasure one can
have than friends.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="817">Oh, come now. Where did all this mushiness come from?
A friend in need is a friend indeed, after all.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="818">She's right, you know. Don't worry about it so much.
We're here to help you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="819">Thank you, both of you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="820">So Adge got into a fight with Duke and stormed out of
the house, hm?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="821">Well then, why don't I think up a quick excuse to call her?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="822">Manna's daughter is at a difficult age, you know.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="823">I also have a daughter, so I understand all too well just
how much she wants her baby girl to come back home.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="824">It's so wonderful to have friends one can trust
and lean on.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="825">I hope Sasha can convince Adge to come back home...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="826">You've been married for quite a long time now,
haven't you, Sasha?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="827">Oh, more years than I want to count.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="828">Though, since you and Jeff are childhood friends, I guess
you could say you've been together your whole lives.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="829">I suppose it does work out that way, doesn't it? Jeff has
never been able to get anything done without me, even as
a kid.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="830">Haha. I still remember how he would follow you like your
little shadow everywhere you went.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="831">Yep. At the first sign of trouble he'd zip right behind me,
quivering like a puppy. It was rather cute, actually.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="832">*giggle* Why, I remember when Duke would pick on him.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You would come flying out of nowhere and rescue him,
sending Duke packing with a few good thwacks!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="833">Haha! Oh, the memories!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Jeff always did have the arm strength of a wet noodle.
Whenever he got into trouble, I had to go save him.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="834">Though, for all the nagging I have to do, I'm still really
grateful to have him.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="835">He gave me Karen and a wonderfully happy family.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="836">My, my! Well, aren't you all lovey-dovey! Tee hee.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="837">Haha. I guess I am.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="838">It must be so nice to have your husband around
all the time.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="839">Sasha and Jeff just make the most wonderful couple,
don't you think?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="840">Goodness, you heard all that? How embarrassing.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="841">Jeff has always been the sort of person that I just
couldn't leave be.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="842">Aha! &lt;playername&gt;, perfect timing!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="843">Aha! &lt;playername&gt;, perfect timing!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="844">Duke has racked up a huge tab with us, and we were just
about to settle it with a little drinking contest.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="845">Yep! If Karen wins, I'll pay up everything I owe on
the spot.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But if I win, Karen said she'll write the whole thing off.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Sounds like a fun little wager, don't you think?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="846">So, yeah. I'd like it if you could watch and, y'know, witness
stuff for us, &lt;playername&gt;. Will you do it?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="847">So, yeah. I'd like it if you could watch and, y'know, witness
stuff for us, &lt;playername&gt;. Will you do it?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="848">This is stupid...</Entry>
  <Entry Index="849">Sure thing.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="850">Hey! I'm serious about this, y'know! Well if that's how
you're gonna be, forget it!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You can just sit there and watch. Duke, let's do this!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="851">Hey! I'm serious about this, y'know! Well if that's how
you're gonna be, forget it!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You can just sit there and watch. Duke, let's do this!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="852">You're on, Karen!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="853">Great! I knew you'd get it, &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="854">Great! I knew you'd get it, &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="855">All right, Duke! Let's do this!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="856">You're on, Karen!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="857">Ha...! Is that it? You never even stood a chance
against me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="858">I'm going home. I'll expect your tab to be paid up in full by
the end of the day. Got it? Good.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="859">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;? Could you do me a favor and help
Duke get home?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I can't leave him lying around on the floor like this...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="860">Thanks. Be careful with him, all right? He looks fit to pop.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="861">...-ing...?
...-arling?
Darling.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="862">Mnnngh?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="863">DARLING!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="864">WH-WHAAAT?!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="865">Don't you "what" me!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="866">Ugh. My stomach feels like it's going to burst...!
Why are you yelling in my ear like that?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="867">&lt;playername&gt; told me everything. You got into a
drinking contest with Karen of all people?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="868">Oh, yeah! I did, I did. So how'd it turn out?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="869">You lost. Big time.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="870">Ah, I lost, huh? Karen sure knows how to hold her juice!
Bwahahahaha!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="871">This is no laughing matter! You made a bet with her that
if you lost, you'd pay off your "tab," right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="872">Geh! Oh, yeah. That part.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="873">You've been buying things without telling me again!
What did you get this time?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="874">Ummm... I, ah--whatever! It was nothing!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="875">Anyway, a promise is a promise. Guess I'll go pay up.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="876">I'll deduct it from your allowance!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="877">Ugh... Okay, okay. Fine.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="878">Hold it! &lt;playername&gt; dragged your sorry self all
the way home, you know. How about first you
apologize for that!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="879">Uh, right. Sorry about that, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="880">&lt;playername&gt;, I can't apologize enough for this
blockhead and his stupidity.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="881">Hey! That's your husband you're calling a blockhead,
you know!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="882">I see nothing wrong with calling a blockhead a blockhead!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="883">Uh oh. Sounds like that's my cue to exit...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="884">Welcome, customer.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="885">Yo! Good to see ya.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="886">I have nothing but the best wares, yes? Anything and
everything you need. Look as much as you like.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="887">Hello!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="888">Yo, Karen! What's up? Don't see ya 'round here much.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="889">Well, I was at the beach anyway, so I figured I might as
well drop by.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I heard someone new had set up shop nearby too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="890">Oh my! What a lovely young lady!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="891">Hm? Who're you?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="892">Who, him?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="893">My name is Huang. I am a merchant. I am honored to
meet you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="894">Oh, you must be the one with the new store.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Hi. I'm Karen. Nice to meet you too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="895">Your name is Karen? An elegant name for an
elegant lady.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="896">Why, thank you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Oh yeah. If you have a store, can I see what
you're selling?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="897">Yes, of course. Here. Look as much as you please.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="898">&lt;playername&gt;! You are in the way, yes? Please move
to the side.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="899">You are in the way of my business. Please move!&lt;wait&gt; </Entry>
  <Entry Index="900">Huh. That's quite the interesting selection you've got.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="901">Karen, today is your lucky day. Now happens to be
"Super Special Bargain Time." One item, any you
like, for free.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="902">Wow, really? Score! ♪&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Then I'll take...this!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="903">A most excellent choice, Karen. Please, take it. I will
accept no money, but you will come see me again, yes?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="904">Sure thing! Thanks a bunch. See you later.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="905">Yo, so it's Super Special Bargain Time now, eh?
I want somethin' too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="906">Sorry. Super Special Bargain Time is over now. I will be
accepting payment for what you buy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="907">Aww, got my hopes all up too!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="908">The world is a cold, cruel place, yes? Now pay for what
you buy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="909">Oh, it's you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I seem down, do I? You're wondering if even physicians
can get sick?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
No, no. It's nothing like that. I was just thinking about
my parents.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="910">My family has a long history of being healers.
My father was a physician, and my mother a nurse.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="911">Our clinic was always busy. As a child, my parents never
seemed to have time for me, and I was very lonely.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
There were even times that I hated the profession.
I fought with them on occasion about it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="912">But once I became one myself, I came to understand
where they were coming from.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's hard to be responsible for the life of another.
If I had known then what I know now, I never would
have pushed as I did.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="913">Oh, forgive me. I shouldn't be burdening you with my
regrets. Please forget about all this.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...I should be going.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="914">...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="915">What?! What does that mean?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="916">It means what it means.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="917">N-No... So I was wrong this whole time.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="918">Facts are facts. Please don't let it bother you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="919">...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="920">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;. What's the matter?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="921">Oh, &lt;nickname&gt;. What's the matter?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="922">You heard us all the way from the waiting room?
Ah, that's unfortunate.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="923">Well, the truth is that we have just learned something
very important about Jeff's body.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="924">Yeah...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Apparently, I don't have the blood type I thought I had.
And I was so sure this whole time too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="925">I sincerely apologize. There must have been some
mistake before.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="926">*siiigh*&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And here I thought all those fortunes based on blood type
were spot on. I was so wrong...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="927">It certainly is strange, though. I can't imagine how I mixed
that up.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="928">I'll have to tell Sasha when I get home. She always
thought it was odd.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="929">She kept saying it was weird for that blood type to have
such a timid personality. She was right.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="930">Even doctors are only human. I certainly always seem
to be doing something wrong.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But this is the first time I've ever seen him make
a mistake.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="931">Hmmm... Doctor, I don't quite understand this part.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="932">Which part? Ah yes, that. It's like this, and...there.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="933">Oh, I see! You're so talented, Doctor.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="934">If there's ever anything you don't understand,
don't hesitate to ask.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="935">I won't. Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="936">Hello, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="937">Hi, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="938">Hi, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="939">Hm? You're wondering what I was doing?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm studying medicine. I want to find a way to make
Grandma's legs better.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="940">I'm sure you will.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="941">Try another clinic.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="942">Thank you for the encouragement. I'll do my best!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="943">With such exemplary work ethic as you have, I'm certain
you'll be able to help your grandmother.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="944">Thank you!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="945">Hm? Another clinic?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Grandma is quite set against leaving this town, though.
I don't want to upset her.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="946">The patient's state of mind is key to recovery. If that's
what Ellen wishes, it's best to keep her here.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="947">Yes, exactly!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="948">I believe in Elly. I'm certain she'll achieve her goal.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="949">I pledge to find a way to heal Grandma's legs.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="950">Yu, let's go to the Clinic and have the doctor take a look
at you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="951">Yes, yes. I think that's for the best.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="952">I don't wanna! I'm fine!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="953">That's enough! You may look fine, but you have a fever!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="954">Sheesh. You're such a worrywart.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="955">Please, can we just go to the Clinic?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="956">Awww, Sis...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="957">Fine. I'll go.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="958">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;. Perfect timing.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="959">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;. Perfect timing.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="960">I think Yu's sick. I'm sorry to be a bother, but could you
help me take him to the Clinic?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's closed today, but I'll find Doctor and ask him to have
a look.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="961">Thank you. If you would then, please.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="962">Mmmm, looks to be just a simple cold. Keep him warm,
let him rest, and he'll be fine.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="963">Really? That's a relief.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="964">See? I told you!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="965">Ugh, that's enough! Do you have any idea how worried
I was?!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="966">...Sorry, Elly.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="967">Go on, then. Thank &lt;playername&gt; and Doctor for
helping.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="968">Go on, then. Thank &lt;playername&gt; and Doctor for
helping.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="969">Thanks, you guys!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="970">Thanks, you two!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="971">&lt;nickname&gt;, could you help bring Yu home,
just in case?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="972">&lt;playername&gt;, could you help bring Yu home,
just in case?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="973">Ah, &lt;playername&gt;! Listen to this!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="974">Ah, &lt;playername&gt;! Listen to this!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="975">I was resting my eyes in the Confessional--spiritual
contemplation, you see--when I heard someone whisper
something to me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="976">They said good fortune would grace my path.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It was surely just an idle fancy from my...meditation,
but I can't stop thinking about it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="977">Yo, Carter! Ya here?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="978">Is something the matter? I don't often see you at this
time of the day.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="979">I came t'tell ya that the thing ya wanted came in.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="980">Oh? You managed to get your hands on it, then?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="981">I couldn't find the darn thing anywhere, but I just got a
call sayin' they had it in stock.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="982">I see. Thank you very much.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="983">Drop by the shop in a bit, and it should be ready. See ya.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="984">Ah. It seems that daydream, I mean, sign from above came
to pass, after all.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Perhaps I should engage in restful contemplation in the
Confessional more often...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="985">Hm? You want to know what I ordered? Hahaha...
I'm afraid that's a secret, for the time being.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="986">Carter doesn't seem to be around. Where'd he go?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="987">The door's open. Maybe I'll peek inside.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="988">Ahhh, autumn is truly the best season. Even I, a penniless
priest, can live in luxury this time of year.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="989">I must keep this secret from the children. Hahaha...
Heeheehee... Now, time to partake.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="990">&lt;playername&gt;? What are you doing here?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="991">&lt;playername&gt;? What are you doing here?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="992">The door was open? I can't believe I was so careless.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="993">You want to know what I was doing? I was...cleaning.
Y-Yes. Just a bit of simple autumn cleaning.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="994">Please don't look at me like that. All right. I confess.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The truth is, I've been picking mushrooms.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="995">Mushrooms are abundant here, and come autumn they
mature enough to eat.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The, ah, frugal nature of my calling means such luxuries
are a rare treat. It's the only time I can really indulge.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I was afraid of others stealing my joy away, so I've kept
it secret.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="996">&lt;playername&gt;, I beg you. Could you keep this
between us?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="997">&lt;playername&gt;, I beg you. Could you keep this
between us?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="998">Thank you very much.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
In gratitude, I'll keep the back door unlocked for you from
now on. Please, come and go as you like.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="999">Now, if you'll pardon me...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1000">I'll head back inside now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1001">Yes, of course. It borders on avarice to keep such things
all to myself. I understand.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
From now on, I'll keep the back door unlocked for you.
Come and go as you please.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1002">Carter's asleep. I should leave him be.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1003">Snow always brings me back. It was snowing the day
I left my hometown too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1004">Welcome. It's a real blizzard out there, huh?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1005">Huh? Cliff...?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1006">Dad! It's an emergency! Cliff is...!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1007">It's a good thing you found him, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1008">It's a good thing you found him, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1009">Truly fortunate, indeed. Whatever was he doing out
there, I wonder.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1010">Thank you so, so much. You even helped carry him to
the Clinic.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1011">He should be fine after some rest. You should all return
home for the time being. Be sure not to catch a cold.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1012">This photo! Where did you find it?!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1013">Oh... Huh. So you told Ran and the others.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The people in this picture are my mother and little sister.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1014">I...hated the town where I grew up, so I left. I ran away
and abandoned my mother and sister.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
When I came back, they were gone. My mother had
passed away, and my sister had disappeared.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
So I wandered around on my own with nowhere to go
until I arrived here.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's...a lot like my hometown.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1015">Ah! Sorry! I'm sure you don't want to hear about all that.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Thank you...for finding this picture.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1016">You're really leaving?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1017">Yeah. Thanks for taking care of me.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
This place...is just too nice for someone like me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1018">You idiot! "Too nice" isn't a bad thing.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1019">Thank you very much. Please say goodbye to everyone
for me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1020">I will. I haven't said anything to Ran. She'll be sad to see
you go, you know. She likes you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1021">...I'll be going now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1022">&lt;playername&gt;... I'm sorry, but I've made up my mind.
It'd be best if you just forgot about me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1023">&lt;playername&gt;... I'm sorry, but I've made up my mind.
It'd be best if you just forgot about me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1024">Thank you for everything. Really.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1025">You're always welcome here! So come back any time!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1026">Today...is the day Ran's mother passed away.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
This one day of the year, Ran lets me have off. I really
appreciate it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1027">I like to spend the whole day just thinking about her.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1028">Quit it already, you two!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1029">Stay out of it, Ran!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1030">Ran, don't you try and stop us!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1031">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;. Please help! They won't stop
fighting!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1032">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;. Please help! They won't stop
fighting!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1033">Intervene</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1034">Don't interfere</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1035">Thanks! You got this!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1036">What do you want, &lt;playername&gt;?!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1037">Out of the way, &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1038">Huh? You wanna know why we're fighting?
Well, obviously...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1039">Well, obviously we're fighting about...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1040">...Uh.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1041">What exactly were we arguing about again?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1042">Seriously?! You can't even remember what you were
fighting about? I'm so done with you two.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1043">Well, shoot. It's completely slipped my mind. Sorry,
&lt;playername&gt;. We'll stop now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1044">Yeah, we're done.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1045">Thanks, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'll be givin' them both an earful, don't you worry!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1046">Thanks, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'll be givin' them both an earful, don't you worry!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1047">What? We can't just do nothing!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Fine! Geez. I guess I can't count on you for anything,
&lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1048">What? We can't just do nothing!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Fine! Geez. I guess I can't count on you for anything,
&lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1049">I can't believe I forgot why we were fighting. Am I that
old already? Anyway, sorry you had to see that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1050">Sorry for all the trouble, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1051">Hmph. I can't just let this go. He's the one who started it
anyway.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1052">Ugh. I wish my dad would stop getting all worked up over
nothing.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1053">You two need to knock it off. Honestly, you're acting like
a bunch of kids.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1054">Phew. I'm glad they stopped. It's terribly hard to enjoy
one's meal over all that shouting.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1055">I can eat in peace now thanks to you, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1056">I wonder what they were fighting about.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1057">This tense atmosphere has soured my meal.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1058">Ahaha, sorry about that. I got a little carried away.
Proves I still have some fire in my belly, though!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1059">Don't talk to me right now. I won't be responsible if you
get hurt. I'm settling this once and for all.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1060">I'm settling this once and for all.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1061">Hrm. I wasn't sure what was going to happen for a
moment there.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1062">Thanks for stepping in. Once those two start, they can be
a bit of a handful by myself.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1063">Maybe I should step in and stop them...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1064">But can I handle both of them by myself?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1065">Hello, &lt;playername&gt;! Sorry, but I'm a bit busy right
now. If you need something, it'll have to wait for later.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1066">Dad.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1067">What is it, Ran? Did something happen?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1068">No, everything's fine. I just wanted to give you something.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1069">Hmm? What's all this now?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1070">Here. Take it. It's a present!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1071">What? Wait, this is...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1072">So you did forget! Today's your birthday, isn't it?
Get it together already. Geez.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1073">Oh yeah! It IS my birthday!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It'd completely slipped my mind. Thanks, honey.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1074">Hope you like it! I'm gonna get to work now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1075">Yeah, thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1076">Daughters are just the best. I'm going to work extra hard
now to be the best dad, too!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1090">Not too many people in today. Not that it ever gets that
busy, though.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1091">Ah well. No point worrying 'bout it. That's life, right?
It is what it is.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1092">Still... I like to think my food's pretty good.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
So how come I'm not getting more customers?
Talk about a mystery.&lt;wait&gt;
</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1093">Kai!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1094">Yo, Popuri! What's up?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1095">Guess what, guess what! I brought a whooooole buncha
customers for you!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1096">What? Seriously? Cool! Tha--&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1097">All right, everyone! Come on in!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1098">Don't worry! There's more! I asked TONS of people
to come!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1099">Holy smokes! That's way too many!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1100">&lt;playername&gt;, there's no way I can handle this many
customers all by myself. You gotta help me out! Please!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1101">&lt;nickname&gt;, there's no way I can handle this many
customers all by myself. You gotta help me out! Please!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1102">Phew! Man, I am BEAT!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Popuri, I'm super happy that you'd bring customers for
me, but that was waaaaay too many.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1103">Aww... I thought that if a few customers would make you
happy, then a whole bunch would make you even happier.
I'm sorry.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1104">Y'know what? I've got a whole new appreciation for the
slow times now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1105">&lt;playername&gt;, you really saved my bacon today.
Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1106">&lt;nickname&gt;, you really saved my bacon today.
Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1107">Boy, am I tired after all that. I think I'll go home and hit
the sack.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1108">Ah! Look! It's Kai! Hi, Kai!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1109">Hey, Kai! Been a while, huh?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You know, when you get here it feels like it's finally time
for summer to start.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1110">Thanks, Popuri. I'll be throwing the doors of the Beach
Cafe open in two days, so come on by!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1111">Yay!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1112">See you later, Kai!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1113">Hm? Hey there, um...? I don't remember seeing you here
last year.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm Kai. Nice to meetcha.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I run the little Cafe down on the beach.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1114">I'm only open during the summer, but come on by if you
want a quick bite of some tasty food.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Tasty food for sale, that is. Gotta make hay while the
summer sun shines, right? Hope to see ya there!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1115">Yo, how's it going? Been a while since I've seen you,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'll be around all summer, so I hope to see you around too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1116">Yo, how's it hanging, &lt;playername&gt;? Been a while,
huh? I'm looking forward to seeing you around.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'll be here all summer again, so don't be a stranger,
you hear?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1117">Yo, how're things, &lt;playername&gt;? It feels like forever
since I saw you. Man, I feel bad about being gone that
long.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'll be around all summer again, though, so let's pick up
where we left off, 'kay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1118">Summer's already over, huh? I'll be closing down the Cafe
and heading to another town when it ends, so figured I'd
say goodbye.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
So...yeah. Hope to see you again next year. Later.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1119">Summer's already over, huh? I'll be heading off soon,
so I thought I'd say my goodbyes.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
So...yeah. Hate to be leaving you behind like this,
but I just gotta go, y'know?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'll be counting the days till I can see you again next year.
Wait for me, 'kay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1120">Summer's already over, huh? I'll be heading off soon,

Wait for me, 'kay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1121">See you next year!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1122">AAAAARGH! Dagnabbit! I don't got the energy to do
nothin' at all!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1123">Hn? Ah, &lt;playername&gt;. Sorry to startle you like that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1124">What? You here to hire me for some renovations or
somethin'? If that's the case, I'll hafta ask you to come
back later.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1125">Right now all my get-up-and-go has got up and went.
I'm stuck in a rut but good.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1126">I'll get out of it eventually, I know. Just gotta find a way
to kick start my engine. But until then, work's a no-go.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1127">Yo, &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1128">I finally got my pep back! Sorry to worry you like that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1129">Lookin' to do some upgrades on the house?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If that's the case, then I'm your man!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1130">G'day, officer. Some nice patrollin' you're doin' there.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1131">Thank you. Things are quiet and peaceful as usual.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1132">That's good to hear. Haven't seen anythin' out of the
ordinary mountain-side, either.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1133">Wonderful. Thank you, as always.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Honestly, I ought to check that area out myself.
You're doing me a great service, Mr. Gotts.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1134">Nah. It's no big deal. Besides, I know the mountain better
than anyone. Who better to check it, then, eh?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I asked to do the job. You don't gotta feel guilty 'bout it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1135">...It's been quite some time since your wife and daughter
passed away on the mountain, hasn't it?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1136">Yeah, that it has. I know they both wouldn't want no one
to go through what they did.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm sure that wherever they are, they're happy I'm the
one watchin' over the mountain for them.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1137">Yes. I'm sure they are.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1138">Mr. Gotts' wife and daughter passed away some
time ago.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Since the accident, he's been doing regular patrols
of the mountain when he can find time away from
his work.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1139">I am very grateful for everything he does.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1140">You take care when you go up the mountain, y'hear?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1141">...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1142">My, my! It's rare we get a visit from you, Zack.
What brings you to our home today?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1143">O-Oh, ah, n-not much. Just happened t'be passin' by,
that's all. So, uh... How're ya doin'?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1144">H-How're ya doin'?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1145">Oh, I've been feeling just wonderful these last few days.
I'm so sorry if I worried you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1146">N-Nah, not at all. I'm just glad t'hear you're gettin' on
all right.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Whenever I hear you've had a bad spell, I just can't sleep
at night.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1147">Whenever I hear you've had a bad spell, I just can't sleep
at night.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1148">Oh, Zack... I never knew you cared so much. Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1149">Y-Yeah, I do... A lot. You...you've finally noticed.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1150">Yes. I'll make sure I get better very soon, so I don't ever
worry you again.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1151">Huh?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1152">Hm? Is something the matter?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1153">Um, n-nothin'. Yeah, uh, I hope you get better real soon
too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1154">Yes. I'll do everything I can. Thank you so much.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1155">N-No, problem. Well, uh...I guess I'd better get goin'.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1156">All right. Take care!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1157">Yo, &lt;playername&gt;. How's it goin'? Me? I...I'm headin'
home. *SIGH*&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1158">Goodness, poor Zack seemed so dispirited when he left.
I wonder what's bothering him.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1159">Poor Zack always seems so shy whenever he talks to me.
And he trips over his tongue a lot. I wonder why.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1160">Hrmmm... Now what am I gonna do with this?
It'd be a waste t'just toss it...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1161">Yo, &lt;playername&gt;. Good timin'! I was just wonderin'
what I should do with this thing.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1162">See, an old buddy of mine moved out an' left his Fishin'
Rod behind. Me, I don't fish.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
So I was wonderin' what t'do with the darn thing.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's still in good shape, so it'd be a shame t'junk it.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
What d'ya say, &lt;playername&gt;? Want it?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I've got an inklin' that you've got a talent for fishin'.&lt;wait&gt;
</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1163">I got a Fishing Rod!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1164">Now get on out there an' fish up a storm!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1165">Ahhh. You have gotten a good item, yes?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1166">Yo, &lt;playername&gt;! I heard the news!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
So you've caught at least one of every kind of fish
out there, eh? Not bad, not bad!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I just knew you were good at fishin'. Didn't I say so?
That rod definitely went to the right person.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Man, if my old buddy heard about this, he'd flip!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But just 'cuz you caught a lot of fish don't mean you
should stop now. Keep reelin' 'em in! See ya later!&lt;wait&gt;
</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1167">Good morning. I am sorry to disturb you at this
early hour.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1168">Ah. I humbly apologize. I have not introduced myself.
I am Huang, a traveling merchant.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I have just arrived in this town. It is an honor to meet you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1169">I see you have a farm, yes?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
As it so happens, I have many seeds for sale.
Rare seeds. Unique seeds. Come see my wares, buy them.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Mr. Zack has generously allowed me to stay at his home.
I have opened my store there.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Come whenever you like. I always welcome
new customers.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1170">Now I must go and greet the other customers in town.
Goodbye.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1171">Good morning. I am sorry to disturb you at this
early hour.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Today I bring a special bargain, just for you.
Three exotic fruit.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1172">They are just for you. You only. No one else.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Ta-dah! Three rare apples. But...they are not just any
apples.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1173">The first is this one. It is named...the SUGDW Apple!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1174">That is the short version. The full name is very long,
so listen well. Ready?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It is the Super Ultra Great Delicious Wonderful Apple!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1175">*pant* *pant* *pant* A very long name, yes? Very long.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1176">The second is this apple. It is...the HMSGB Apple!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1177">This apple, too, has very long name. So listen well...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It is the Hyper Miracle Sweet Gorgeous Beautiful Apple!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1178">Last but not least...the AEPFE Apple!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1179">As with the others, its name is quite long. Are you ready?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It is the Angel Eternal Pure Fresh Elegant Apple!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1180">All three are special apples. Very special. How special you
will see when you eat them.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1181">But I will sell them to you for a special bargain price.
Only 500G each. Quite the steal, yes?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1182">Which will you buy?</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1183">The SUGDW Apple.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1184">The HMSGB Apple.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1185">The AEPFE Apple.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1186">Sorry, not interested.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1187">Thank you very much for your purchase! I did not think
anyone would actually buy them...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Ahem! I mean, you have very good taste, dear customer.
Very good. Now I must go. Goodbye.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1188">You do not have 500G?
My friend, you have very poor luck.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1189">Good morning. I am sorry to disturb you at this
early hour.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I notice your house is very nice. Very good feng shui.
For you and your nice house, I bring a special bargain.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1190">Even the nicest houses can feel lonely sometimes.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
To make sure it is not lonely, I offer you this Vase!
Only 5,000G. It will make your whole house pretty
and happy. Quite a deal, yes?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1191">Buy</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1192">Don't buy</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1193">And this is a special Vase. It has a very unique feature.
You can put flowers in it! That will make your whole
house even happier.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1194">Just a Vase alone, it doesn't do much, yes?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1195">Having useless decorations makes the heart feel good.
But! Having nothing makes it feel sad.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1196">Good day. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance
and my honor to offer a few trifles for sale in this
lovely town.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I will be showcasing my wares every Wednesday on the
second floor of the Inn.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I trade in several unique and difficult to find items,
so I highly recommend you pay me a visit.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I also open a Pet Shop on the 15th of each month
in the Plaza.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
This, of course, excludes months when a festival falls
on the 15th. That takes precedence!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Now then, I'm afraid I must excuse myself. Goodbye.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1197">G'morning! I'm Lou. Nice to meet ya! I'll be dropping by
Mineral Town to buy ingredients every once in a while.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I've heard all about the good stuff you can get here,
so I figured I'd snag some for myself.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I run a little inn, you see, and I love to cook for my guests.
You'll find me at the Inn every Sunday. Come on by and
say hi!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1198">Oookay! Everybody in their seats?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1199">YES!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1200">Good! Let's begin...the Nature Sprites' Tea Party!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1201">Tea parties are so fun!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1202">&lt;playername&gt;, you're our guest today.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1203">We give presents to our guests. Here!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1204">I hope you'll come back next year. We'll all be waiting to
see you!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1205">Pan paka paaan! Congratulations!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
&lt;playername&gt;, you've collected all of the Goddess
Jewels! As a special prize, I will trade you all of them
for...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Ta-daaaaah! ♪ This one of a kind Goddess' Treasure! ♪
Enjoy! Bye-bye now!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1206">...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1207">You collected all Kappa Jewels. I trade you them for
Kappa's Treasure. Go away and don't come back.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1208">How... How could you do something like that? I'm so
disappointed in you. If anything happens, don't come
crying to me!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1209">I expected better of you, &lt;playername&gt;. You think
you're big stuff, huh? Well, from now on I'm going to call
you Money Pants!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1210">I don't have to tell you why I'm mad, do I? No, siree. You
best think on what you did! You think REAL hard, you
hear?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1211">I hate you, &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1212">I hate you, &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1213">Bah! Young folk these days! No manners at all! I just
can't understand what's going on in their rotten little
minds.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1214">Do you know what you've done? I don't mind a good joke,
but this is just tasteless. Knock it off!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1215">My goodness. It's just unbelievable! Now, I know you're
young yet, and young people make mistakes.
But this? This is no small matter. I don't know if you'll
ever be able to make up for it, but you'd best try!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1216">I can't believe what you've done. You...you...! You've
practically desecrated Mother Nature herself!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1217">It's just shocking. I don't even know what to say.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1218">Is it any wonder everyone is upset? I warned you that
Golden Lumber would do this!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But you still went and displayed it on your farm anyway,
and now the whole town is in an uproar! Take it down at
once!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1219">The citizens of Mineral Town are quite upset at your, ah,
decoration. I suggest you take it down at once or I will
arrest you!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1220">Whoa. I know I play pranks on people, but even I wouldn't
go this far. You're a monster, &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1221">Whoa. I know I play pranks on people, but even I wouldn't
go this far. You're a monster, &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1222">You know, it takes an awful lot to make me angry, but
this has done it. I am good and mad at you!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1223">What on earth did you think you were doing? Take that
shameless thing down at once!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1224">You may be wealthy in riches, but your soul is poor and
barren.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1225">You're unbelievable. What, do you need people to get mad
at you before you understand?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1226">I guess you weren't the man I took you for. You aren't a
man at all.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1227">You're unbelievable. What, do you need people to get mad
at you before you understand?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1228">Yo, take that tacky thing down already! Ain'tcha
embarrassed?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1229">I heard rumor of your latest, ah...faux pas even all the
way over in my town.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
How absolutely distasteful. You ought to be ashamed of
yourself.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1230">Oh my, my, my. Now you've done it. Even the gods are
angry with you. I think you had better take that down,
pronto.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1231">Outrageous! You still have that garish Golden Lumber up!
What unbelievable gall!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's an eyesore that degrades the entire town. Remove it
AT ONCE!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1232">&lt;playername&gt;, I see that you have found the last
of the Truth Jewels. Could I ask you to come with
me for a moment?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1233">&lt;playername&gt;, since you've collected all of the
Truth Jewels, I will trade you those...for THIS.
The Truth Treasure!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1234">...Or I would, but you haven't any space in your Bag.
Come see me again when you've made some room.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1235">Ah, excellent. You've got space in your Bag now.
Then without further ado, allow me to trade you
for the Truth Treasure.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1236">Please make some space in your Bag and come see
me again.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1237">Oh, look! A falling star. Wow, it's so pretty...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1238">Oh, I know! I should make a wish.
Hmm... What to wish for?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1239">My animals to like me better.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1240">My friendships to bloom.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1241">My shipments to earn more.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1242">I hope my wish comes true...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1243">Pan paka paaan! As of right now, your Pedometer has

so many steps...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
This once--and this once only!--I will give you a special
prize.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Here. It's a ring. Oh, but you can't wear it or equip it,
though. Mind that part.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If you look at the Farm Information menu, you will see it
displayed below your farm's information.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And that's all! Bye-bye!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1265">One day, a special letter arrived in my mailbox.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It was sent from a person who introduced himself as the
mayor of a certain little town.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The moment I finished reading that letter, I packed up my
things and headed for the train station.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Once there I bought a ticket, a ticket to Mineral Town.
The place where my grandfather had his farm...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1266">Good day! You are &lt;playername&gt;, I presume?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1267">I'm Thomas. It is my great honor to preside over
Mineral Town as its mayor.&lt;wait&gt; </Entry>
  <Entry Index="1268">I've been waiting for you. Please, allow me to show you to
the farm.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1269">Here it is. This is the land your grandfather left to you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm afraid it's been some time since anyone tended to it,
so it's fallen into a bit of disrepair.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1270">Do you remember when you came here as a child?
You spent a summer together with your grandfather.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1271">I'm sorry, &lt;playername&gt;. We've had to cancel our
family vacation this summer.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1272">I just couldn't get the time off for it. There's something
very important that I have to do at work, and I can't
leave.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm really sorry, but you'll have to make do without a trip
this year. Things are just too busy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1273">I promise I'll make it up to you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1274">I'm so sorry, &lt;playername&gt;, but please understand.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
We may not get a family vacation, but we have asked
your grandfather to let you stay with him at his farm
this summer.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1275">His farm is wonderful. It's surrounded by nature with all
sorts of places to explore. You can relax and play as much
as you like.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
We've already packed your things. All that's left is to go
and have fun!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1276">Oh ho, there you are, &lt;playername&gt;.
Do you remember me? I'm your grandpa.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
There ain't too much to do out here in the sticks, but go
have a nosey around if you like.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1277">I'm afraid I'll be busy most of the day doin' my chores
around the farm, so I won't have much time to play
with you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
There are a few kids around your age in town, though.
I'm sure they'll let you play with them, so go on and
introduce yourself.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1278">Oh yeah! Someone said the old guy at the farm down the
road was having a visitor from the city.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
That must be him. I wonder what he's doing all by himself.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1279">Oh yeah! Someone said the old guy at the farm down the

  <Entry Index="1280">Do you always play alone? Wow! Me too!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I like this place lots, so I come here all the time.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1281">Hey, why don't you tell me about yourself, and the city,
and stuff. What's it like there?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1282">Well, &lt;playername&gt;? How'd you like the country life?
Was it fun?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
When you get back home, say hello to your mom and dad
for me. And let 'em know I enjoyed havin' you come visit.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1283">Aww, are you going already?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1284">Oh. I'll miss you. You'll be coming back someday,
though, right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1285">Promise me you'll come back.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1286">It's been 20 years since then. I see you've grown into
a fine young adult.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1287">Your grandfather loved this little farm dearly, you know.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm sure it would make him oh so happy to know that you
had inherited it.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Well? What do you say? Would you like to give farming
a try?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1288">Yes</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1289">No</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1290">I see... Well, the decision is yours, and I won't try to
change your mind. What a shame, though.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If you'll be leaving, there should be another train coming
soon. Goodbye, &lt;playername&gt;...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1291">Excellent, excellent! Allow me to be the first to welcome
you as a new resident of Mineral Town!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1324">Hey now! This is private property! The owner may be

  <Entry Index="1325">What, you know the elderly gentleman who used to live
here?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm afraid he passed away. You didn't know?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1326">Yes, it was half a year ago.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
When I was organizing his things afterwards, I found his
will on the bookshelf.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It simply said, "I leave my farm to &lt;playername&gt;."&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Thus, until &lt;playername&gt; arrives, I have taken it upon
myself to maintain his property as best I can.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1327">What? You are &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1328">I see. If you wouldn't mind, could you please tell me how
you knew the old gentleman?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1329">Ah, you two were pen pals? I see.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And when the replies stopped coming, you came to visit
and find out why.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1330">Well, he did mention in his will that he wanted you to
have the farm. You seem like a reliable enough sort.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
How about it? Would you like to give farming a try?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1331">All right, that decides that! This farm now belongs to you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1332">Running a farm is not the easiest of jobs in the world.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

I figured we could at least treat today like it's a LITTLE

child sees to be our smiling faces.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1801">Now, do you have a name in mind, &lt;nickname&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1802">&lt;childname&gt;... Yes, that's the perfect name for
our child.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

Wow, babies are TINY. Our kid is so cute.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

I'm sure &lt;childname&gt; will like it too.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm &lt;childname&gt;'s papa now. Okay, I have to work

You can decide, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1816">&lt;childname&gt;, huh? Yeah, I like that. Done and done.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
&lt;childname&gt;'s gonna like it too, I'll bet.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1841">When I woke up, &lt;childname&gt; was standing right by
me. Apparently, the little rascal slipped right out of bed.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

up for today.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1862">Sorry... I guess I'm not feeling very well today.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And now I've made a hassle for Duke and Manna too.
I can't believe I fainted. Pitiful...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1863">I have to get better by tomorrow. Hopefully sleeping it
off today should do the trick.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1864">How could this happen? So this is what it means to fail to
practice what you preach.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I thought I was taking good care of my health, so why did
this happen? I'd like to investigate the cause.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
No, no... Apologies. It's hard for me to turn off the
analytical part of my brain at times like this.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

by tomorrow. Good night.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

Guess I've got no right to argue when Grandpa calls me

birthday present, yes?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2040">I got a ring!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2041">Good morning, &lt;nickname&gt;. You have been looking
unwell of late. Did you eat something that didn't agree
with you?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2042">It would be terrible if this were some serious illness.
You ought to see Doctor, just in case.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2043">Let us collect our things and go.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2044">Congratulations, both of you!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2045">To think that you were pregnant...! I sup upon the

  <Entry Index="2047">&lt;playername&gt;, it seems that you are pregnant.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2048">Good morning, &lt;nickname&gt;. You do not look well.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2049">I do not think it is serious. Stagnant chi, maybe. But one
should consult a doctor just in case, yes?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2050">Let us get our things and go.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2051">Congratulations, both of you!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2052">Aiyaaah! We are having a child?! And I...I will be a papa.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2053">Must we still wait? I hope nothing untoward has
happened. It would be worse than an accident
in the kitchen.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2054">I see... It seems there is little I can do besides pray that
you and our child will make it through safely.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2055">Yes... Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2056">&lt;nickname&gt;, this ordeal will soon be over. I'm sure
it must have been very difficult for you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2057">Now for an important question... What shall we name
our child?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2058">&lt;childname&gt;? What a lovely name.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2059">Baby. Born.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2060">Give it a name.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2061">...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2062">Is our baby born yet? Perhaps now? How about now?
...When will it be born? I dislike waiting.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2063">You look very worn, yes? Very tired. Just looking at you,
I feel like I may keel over in sympathy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2064">Yes, yes. Okay. Many thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2065">&lt;nickname&gt;, the wait is nearly over.
You did very well.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2066">Now, an important question. What will we name
our child?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2067">&lt;childname&gt;, yes? Ooh. Very auspicious. I think it is
a good name.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2068">There is something I would like you to see.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2069">&lt;childname&gt;, would you do it again?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2070">Daaah.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2071">&lt;childname&gt; has already learned how to walk.
How quickly the time passes.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2072">I hope &lt;childname&gt; will soon be old enough to enjoy
my exquisite home cooking.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2073">...Look. Watch.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2074">Daaah.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="2076">Come, come. Come to Papa.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2077">Well? Very surprising, yes?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2078">Soon, I will introduce our child to the wide world of
apples. There is much to teach.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2079">&lt;nickname&gt;! Oh, &lt;nickname&gt;! It is terrible!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2080">When I awoke this morning, &lt;childname&gt; had fallen
from bed! I think the poor thing is injured!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
What do we do now?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2081">You seem to be downplaying the severity of this
situation! What if it is actually something terrible?&lt;wait&gt; </Entry>
  <Entry Index="2082">We're going to the Clinic right away. Even if it is closed,
I will go straight to Doctor! Come, &lt;childname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2083">O-Oh. Yes, of course! We must take the little one to the
Clinic right away.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2084">Don't worry, &lt;childname&gt;. You will be just fine.
We are taking you to see Doctor now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2085">Are you certain everything is all right...? The poor thing
cried an awful lot.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2086">Yes... Yes, thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="2113">Huh? Weird. I guess the power went out?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2114">Ugh. You're kidding. A blackout?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2115">Hm? My, my. It seems the power went out.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2116">Hrm. We seem to have a blackout on our hands.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2117">Aiyah! What happened? This is a blackout, yes?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2118">My, my. It seems the power went out.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2119">Eep! What the heck? Who turned out the lights?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2120">Ack! Uh-oh, I guess the power just went out.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2121">Huh? What's going on? Did someone turn off the lights?
...Wait, or is this a blackout?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2122">Hm? It's pitch black...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2123">Eek! ...Oh, a blackout, I guess?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2124">Hm? The flow of energy has shifted... Has Mother Nature
revoked her blessing?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2125">Aah!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Did the power just go out?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2126">...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2127">Oh, good. They fixed it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2128">Phew! The lights are back on. Good thing nothing major
went wrong, huh?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2129">Ah. It's fixed. That's good.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2130">Phew. Good thing they fixed it quick. Sheesh. Didn't need
THAT heart attack today.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2131">Aha. There we go. They fixed it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2132">There. The power is back. We may now sleep in peace.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2133">Ah. The light finally returns. Now, early to bed, early to
rise makes us healthy and wealthy, yes?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2134">Ah. The lights have come back on.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2135">Oh, phew. The lights are back. Geez, that was NOT a cute
surprise.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2136">Ah! And we're back in business. I'm glad it wasn't
anything serious.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2137">Ugh! About time! That wasn't a fun surprise at all.
I don't like surprises that aren't fun.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2138">There, the lights have come back. Phew. I'm glad it wasn't
anything terrible.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2139">Geez, now THAT was a surprise. Were we the only ones
affected? I hope my family is okay.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2140">Aah, the light returns. The spirits must have reconnected
the ley lines slumbering beneath the earth.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2141">Aha! The power's back.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2142">Welcome home, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I have prepared a grand feast for us to enjoy this noon
hour. Please dig in. There is plenty for us both.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2143">Mm. A delightfully delicious dinner, if I do say so myself.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Now for the dishes. You needn't hover while I wash.
Why don't you step outside for a moment?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2144">Welcome home, &lt;nickname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I have prepared a most sumptuous buffet for our supper.
Please dig in. I made enough for seconds.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2145">Oh no...! &lt;mydogname&gt; doesn't look so good.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2146">&lt;nickname&gt;, let's take &lt;mydogname&gt; to the
Clinic.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2147">&lt;mydogname&gt; doesn't look well at all. Is something
wrong?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2148">I should take the poor thing to the Clinic and have Doctor
take a look.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2149">There, that ought to do it. &lt;mydogname&gt; is officially
on the mend.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2150">However...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2151">&lt;mydogname&gt; was ill because you were neglecting
your responsibility as a pet owner.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I highly recommend you pay more attention to
&lt;mydogname&gt; so this doesn't happen again.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2152">Come to think of it, we haven't played together in a while.
I'm sorry, &lt;mydogname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2153">&lt;mydogname&gt; looks pretty down. Is the poor thing
not feeling well?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2154">Maybe I should let you inside the house for a while, buddy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2155">There. You seem a lot happier now.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I haven't paid much attention to you lately, so I hadn't
even noticed you were sad. I'm sorry, &lt;mydogname&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2156">...*knock* *knock* *knock*...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2157">Good evening, &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2158">Good evening.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2159">Hope you don't mind if we invade your space for a sec!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2160">Hey, um, &lt;playername&gt;? We heard you got a Big Bed,
so all us girls decided to come over and check it out.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2161">Yeah! I've always wondered what it would be like to flop
down on one of those huuuge beds.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2162">And, y'know, if the stars align and all that, we wouldn't
mind turning this into a slumber party...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2163">I'm sorry we all dropped in on you unannounced like this.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2164">It's not every day that all seven of us get together
like this.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Anyway, is it all right if we see your bed?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2165">Ummm... Boy, this gives new meaning to the
word "cramped."&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It IS a really, really big bed, but I guess it isn't big enough
for seven people at once.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2166">Uh, yeah. I mean, I already fell off.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2167">I, too, have been forsaken by its pillowy embrace.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2168">It looks like our slumber party idea isn't going to come to
fruition. That's too bad.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2169">Yes. It isn't good for your health to sleep on a drafty
floor, after all.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2170">Aww, dang it! I was really looking forward to having a
sleepover. Alas. C'mon, girls. Let's skedaddle.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2171">Yeah. Sorry for bugging you. Thanks for letting us come
over, though!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2172">Thank you. Good night.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2173">Think maybe we can try for sleepover round two some
other time? That'd be cool. G'night!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2174">Good night. Take care.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2175">See ya tomorrow! G'niiight!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2176">Until next time. May the moon's energies lull you into
peaceful slumber.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2177">Well, that was...something. I guess it's time for bed.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2178">Hi, &lt;playername&gt;! Make us something yummy to eat! ♪&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2179">Please pardon the intrusion.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2180">Yeah. Sorry to drop in on you. But I heard you're a great
cook and I was hoping you could make me something.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2181">Might I ask you to make something for me, too?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2182">Me too, please! I'm staaarving!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2183">This will be a fiercely fantabulous meal, I'm sure.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2184">So, yeah, surprise! The whole gang's here. Mind if we sit
at your table?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2185">Oh, it would be wonderful if you could ask everyone what
they'd like to have first.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2186">Definitely. Once you're done with one dish, bring it on
over. No need to wait until it's all done to serve.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2187">I'm sure you can do no wrong in the kitchen, but this is a
special occasion. Please mind our requests.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2188">So, yeah! I know this is a lot to put on your plate--heh--
but couldja make something for all of us?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2189">I am sure you are capable. The voices of the spirits have
spoken to me, and they say you can do anything.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2190">Coming right up!</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2191">It'll be a kitchen nightmare...</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2192">Really? Aww. Oh well. I guess that's a no.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2193">We certainly wouldn't want to force you to cook for us,
after all.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2194">We'll just take a rain check until the day you DO feel up
to it. How 'bout that?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2195">This WAS very sudden, after all. I'm sorry about that.
Everyone, we should probably leave &lt;playername&gt;
in peace.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2196">Yeah, you're right. But maaan, I'm still so huuungry.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2197">And here I thought I'd sensed the radiant aura of
potential enveloping you. Perhaps I imagined it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2198">Well, I guess that's that. Sorry for bugging you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2199">Yaaay! ♪&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2200">We will wait here at the table, then.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2201">Yep. We'll be patient. Mostly. Kinda.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2202">Oh, please be sure to put away what you're holding
before you come to take our orders.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2203">Huzzah! We'll be waiting.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="2304">I see. A pity. I realize now that there is danger to raising
one's expectations too high.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2305">All right. I will wait patiently, with earnest belief
in your ability.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2306">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;. Mind if we come in?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2307">Yo. We brought the whole gang along today.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2308">Um... Sorry to bother you...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2309">Sorry to drop in like a rain cloud spoilin' a day at the
beach, but word on the street is you're a MEAN cook.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2310">We decided we should get together and put that rumor
to the test, and, well, there is no time like the present.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2311">...I, for one, was in favor of exercising restraint.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2312">Yeah, I know we're kiiinda getting in your hair here,
&lt;playername&gt;, but I figured you wouldn't mind.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2313">"Kinda"? I mean, all of us are going to ask for totally
different things to eat, too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2314">This is a bit high-handed, yes, but I fear my curiosity was
too much to bear. We'd like to see your skills.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2315">If you can't, just say so, 'kay? We know this is a big favor
you're doing us. No one's gonna DEMAND anything.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2316">...I'm not about to press the issue.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2317">Only if you don't mind. Really. But, um...what do you say?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2318">Ah. Oh well. That's that, I guess.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2319">Hahaha. Toldja this was too wild of an idea.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2320">Yeah, shoulda figured this was too sudden to spring on
our pal here.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2321">Let's see if we can't plan a little better next time,
difficult as it may be with our disparate schedules.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2322">Yeah. It was more or less a miracle that we were all
free at the same time today.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2323">I did not come expecting much, but I must say I find some
melancholy in leaving empty-handed.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2324">Sorry to bother you with all this. See you later.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2325">What, really? You don't mind? Awesome! I guess you miss
100% of the shots you don't take, huh?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2326">Right on. We'll hang out and wait at the table.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2327">Yeah, let's all have a seat and let &lt;playername&gt;
handle the cooking.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2328">By the way, would you please put away whatever you
may be holding when you come ask us what we'd like?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2329">Okay, um... If you really don't mind...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="2338">I'll have some &lt;string0&gt;--that is,
if you don't mind. Is it maybe too hard of a recipe?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Would you rather call it off this time?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2339">Wow, it's done already? Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2340">All right, time to dig in.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="2428">Oh well! No one will notice anyway.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I will just put them in whichever basket feels right.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2429">I must finish before anyone comes along and sees me, yes?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2430">...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2431">AIYAAAH! &lt;playername&gt;! Wh-When did you get
here?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2432">D-Did you perhaps...overhear me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2433">Erm! That was just a little joke. I am a merchant,
so I can easily tell apples apart. Very easily!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2434">Here. I'll give you this, and you keep this little "joke"
between us. Yes?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2435">Now I must clean. Please step outside for a moment.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2436">Aah, &lt;playername&gt;. You've come at a good time.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I have a challenge for you. You will accept, I'm sure.
In fact, I will not let you refuse.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Now, let us begin!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2437">To your left is...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2438">A Super Ultra Great Delicious Wonderful Apple.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2439">A Hyper Miracle Sweet Gorgeous Beautiful Apple.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2440">An Angel Eternal Pure Fresh Elegant Apple.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2441">In the center is...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2442">To your right, is...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2443">A Super Ultra Great Delicious Wonderful Apple.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2444">A Hyper Miracle Sweet Gorgeous Beautiful Apple.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2445">An Angel Eternal Pure Fresh Elegant Apple.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2446">I will shuffle the apples. You will guess which apple
is which.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Okay. Pay attention now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2447">Now... Which is the Super Ultra Great Delicious
Wonderful Apple?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Point to it, yes?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2448">Now... Which is the Hyper Miracle Sweet Gorgeous
Beautiful Apple?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Point to it, yes?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2449">Now... Which is the Angel Eternal Pure Fresh Elegant
Apple?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Point to it, yes?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2450">Point left.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2451">Point center.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2452">Point right.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2453">You have the eyes of an eagle, &lt;playername&gt;!
Correct.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2454">This time, I will shuffle the apples faster, yes?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2455">Incorrect, &lt;playername&gt;. Is that the best you can do?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If you wish to challenge me, you must first hone your
apple-guessing skills.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2456">Oh ho. You are very skilled to make it this far!
I will give you this as a prize.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2457">But you tried very hard to come this far, yes? I will give
you this as a prize.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2458">I must clean up the apples now, yes? Please step outside.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="2483">...What's this? It seems your Tool Pocket is full!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I will not rummage through your Tool Pocket. If there is
no space, your prize won't fit, and you won't get it.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Staring at me with that face will do you no good! This is
how I operate. It is what it is!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="2484">A sequence of numbers is a big win, yes? Congratulations.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

If you want to sell something, simply bring it to me, yes?
That is all.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

our little cherub will someday become.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3715">Good morning, &lt;nickname&gt;. What is wrong?
You look pale.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3716">You ought to go to the Clinic and see Doctor.
I will accompany you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3717">Come. Let's be on our way.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3718">Congratulations, both of you!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3719">We are...expecting a child? I...I see.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Haha... Parents. We're going to be parents, aren't we?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3720">The thought has been in the back of my mind since
we were first married...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But now that I am faced with the reality of it,
I find it more difficult than I anticipated to
maintain my composure.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I will do everything in my power to assist you,
&lt;nickname&gt;. You concentrate on taking care
of yourself.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3721">Incidentally, we ought to tell Gotts the good news as well.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

not ready to enter this world yet, perhaps...?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

I hope everything will turn out all right for you,

  <Entry Index="3724">Erm...yes. Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3725">&lt;nickname&gt;... Well done.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

As human beings, we all came into this world in the same
way, didn't we? You. Me. Everyone.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Now, what name shall we bestow upon our little angel?
I will leave it to you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

perfect name.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

Aah...! My thought process is in a frenzy. I can barely

  <Entry Index="3817">You cannot be serious. What if the worst has happened,

  <Entry Index="3822">Yes. Yes, we will.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3823">&lt;childname&gt;, I am so sorry. We were cautious,

  <Entry Index="3824">My, my! Now isn't THIS unusual? Look over there.
It's Brandon.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Why, I can't remember the last time I saw him come
down into town.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3825">Brandon...? Do you mean that slightly eccentric--
Actually, no. I won't mince words. That HIGHLY strange
hermit?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3826">I hear he is supposed to be very easy on the eyes and an
excellent artist, but also, well...very, very strange.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3827">Oh, yes, I've heard the same!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3828">Yes, that's him! And here he is, gracing our town with his...
unique presence.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3829">Word is that he's a world-famous artist, you know.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Why, I hear that rich people from aaall over are lining up
to pay top dollar for his works.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
In fact, a little birdie told me that his bank account has
a positively mind-boggling number of zeros in it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3830">Whaaat? Really?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3831">Where on earth did you hear something like that?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3832">Aaah, a handsome gentleman staring pensively at the
clouds... Now THAT'S what I call art.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3833">Handsome and rich is quite the one-two punch,
that's for sure.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3834">Oh, just look at that divine expression of ennui
as he gazes wistfully at the heavens above...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I wonder, do you think he might be interested in taking my
little Adge as a bride?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Yes, she isn't living in town right now, and I can't say
when she'll come back, but that isn't THAT bad... Right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3835">Worse than bad, I'd say. Hard to date someone you've
never met when they aren't even here.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But anyway, you will not BELIEVE what happened
yesterday. Ugh. I can hardly believe it myself.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3836">Ooh! Now THIS I need to hear. Dish!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3837">Enough. I cannot take another moment of this.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Argh, will they never cease?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3838">Hm? Am I all right, you ask? Why would I not be?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3839">I was simply waiting for the sky to present me with my
next duty to fulfill.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3840">A veritable flood of information will rush down from on
high if you only look up. Organizing it is no small feat.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
All the voices in my head clamoring for attention
RIGHT NOW... It takes all of my might simply to put
them in order.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3841">Was I talking to myself? Ah. I apologize.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3842">When I take an afternoon stroll, there are times when
inspiration strikes me like a bolt from the blue.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Breathing the fresh air as I walk must energize the font
of inspiration within me until it overflows.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3843">Now, then. My thoughts have finally been corralled into
some semblance of order, so I will be on my way.
Good day.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3844">So after chewing on the idea a little...
&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The idea of a parent deciding who their child will marry
seems ridiculously out-of-date to me. Really, it's just silly.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
How could I expect Adge to be happy with anyone
not of her own choosing? In fact, she may not even
want to get married!&lt;wait&gt; </Entry>
  <Entry Index="3845">True. Our children aren't miniature versions of ourselves.
They should be the ones to shape their own futures.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3846">Oh, definitely. I wholeheartedly agree. But be that as it
may, I'll never turn down a little eye candy...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Hm? Wait a minute...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3847">Where did Brandon go? He was here just a second ago.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3848">I guess artists are the impatient sort.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3849">Oh. &lt;playername&gt;. Hello.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3850">You wouldn't happen to have seen Officer Harris out and
about, would you?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3851">No? Well, I will wait a little longer, then.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3852">You are familiar with his patrol route, yes? He ought
to be passing by here before terribly long.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Thus, I thought to wait here for him. I have something
I'd like to give to him.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3853">Hello, Miss Jennifer. And hello to you, too,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3854">Hello, Officer Harris. I've been waiting for you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3855">You...have?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3856">The other day, you were walking down the mountain in
the dark and happened to twist your ankle, did you not?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Gotts was kind enough to inform me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3857">Goodness. It's amazing how quickly rumors make their
way through town.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3858">But yes, you heard rightly. I am embarrassed
to admit that I tripped over my own two feet
and twisted my ankle.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Fortunately enough, it wasn't all that bad. It had healed
by morning.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3859">Considering you have the protection of the mountain
spirits, I doubt that any truly grave accident would befall
you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But knowing that you patrol these paths gives me peace
of mind as I cloister myself within my tent.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Thus, I thought I might give you this in gratitude for all
the good you do for our community.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3860">This is a power stone. It is imbued with positive energies
that will protect you from accident and harm.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
This mountain abounds with good energy, and power
stones are plentiful. This one happened to be the
strongest I found.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I hope you will find it to your liking.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3861">Goodness! A gift? For me?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Thank you very much for your kindness and consideration.
I'm sure this will be most effective.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I gladly accept your thoughtful gift, and will take good
care of it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3862">Now then, I'd best return to my patrol. If you will please
excuse me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3863">Of course. Good day, Officer Harris.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3864">You know...? It's hard to shake the feeling that poor
Officer Harris is struggling under an unlucky sign.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Not in terms of health, though. I have little worry that
illness or injury will befall him. No, I speak of romance.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3865">I hope that power stone will counteract some of his poor
luck and bring him into alignment with an auspicious star.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3866">I'm sure it was no coincidence you happened to be here,
&lt;playername&gt;. I thought I'd give you a stone as well...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3867">But I get the impression you don't need it.
I feel a strong energy about you, as if you
have spiritual protection.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You know, I have wondered this for some time now, but...
Who exactly ARE you, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3868">Good morning, &lt;nickname&gt;.
Tell me, what day is it today?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3869">Your birthday.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="3870">What...? My birthday?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

farmer. I see Jeff roped you into this as well?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4025">You see, &lt;playername&gt;, I have a little story I'd like
you to hear.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
When Basil stopped by the shop yesterday, we got to
chatting about all sorts of interesting plants.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
There was one in particular he mentioned that stuck out
to me: a flower that can convey emotion.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But for all you know about it, Basil, you said you still
haven't seen one for yourself?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4026">That I haven't. The only records of its existence are in
ancient texts. There is no guarantee it hasn't gone
extinct.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Jeff was rather disappointed. Jeff, I believe you said it
would be handy for expressing your feelings to Sasha?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4027">AHEM! Basil! Did you really have to mention that?
Now I've gone all red in the face.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4028">Hahaha. There's nothing wrong with having emotions,
my friend. I'm sure &lt;playername&gt; sympathizes.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4029">Hahaha. There's nothing wrong with having emotions,
my friend. I'm sure &lt;playername&gt; sympathizes.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4030">Er, anyway... We were talking about how it would be nice
to have a way to express our feelings to others directly.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You're getting to be that age too, &lt;playername&gt;.
So we thought you might agree with us on that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4031">Er, anyway... We were talking about how it would be nice
to have a way to express our feelings to others directly.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You're getting to be that age too, &lt;playername&gt;.
So we thought you might agree with us on that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4032">And besides, wouldn't it be romantic to hand that special
someone a flower when you tell them how you feel?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4033">But at the end of the day, that flower is still only a
rumor. No one I know can say for certain if it exists.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4034">I wonder what it would look like. I'm sure it must be
beautiful.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4035">Ooh! Ooh! I've heard about that flower! But I haven't
seen it either.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4036">I wanna see it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4037">Me too, me too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4038">If we all want to see it, I guess we'll just have to make
one bloom!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4039">Hi, &lt;playername&gt;! Your farm looks really good!
You must work suuuper hard on it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4040">Wow! It's been a long, looong time since someone
could see us.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Your name is &lt;playername&gt;, huh? It's nice to
meet you!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4041">Guess what? We came to go shopping!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4042">H-Hey! What does that look mean? We pay for what we
buy with real money!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4043">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;. We've heard about that flower.
And we want to try and make one bloom!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4044">If you want, you can come see too, &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4045">Hm? &lt;playername&gt;, is something the matter?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4046">Hm? &lt;playername&gt;, is something the matter?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4047">Ah. Farm work waits for no one, eh?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4048">Well, thank you for listening to my little story.
Keep up the good work on your farm!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4049">Okay, &lt;playername&gt;. Follow us!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="4057">For now, here. Please give one each to Mr. Jeff and
Mr. Basil.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4058">Now for the important part... The party! We have to
celebrate the great success of our grand experiment!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4059">&lt;playername&gt;, keep up the good work, okay? All of us
wish you the very best!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="4061">Oh. Why, hello, &lt;playername&gt;. Welcome back.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4062">Hahaha. Yep, you got us. Jeff and I are still talking about
that flower.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4063">So, have you come to do some shopping?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4064">So, have you come to do some shopping?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4065">&lt;playername&gt;... Th-That flower!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4066">&lt;playername&gt;... Th-That flower!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4067">Wait a minute! Don't tell me you actually FOUND the
flower we were talking about?!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4068">You are just...giving this to me? Are you sure?!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4069">You are just...giving this to me? Are you sure?!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4070">Now THIS is a wonderful present! See, I like to dabble in
painting, and I think I will make this flower my next motif!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4071">Ah, before I forget. &lt;playername&gt;, since you
discovered this flower, would you like to give it a name?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It might have a formal name already, but that would take
digging to find. Why not give it something more palatable?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4072">Ah, before I forget. &lt;playername&gt;, since you

  <Entry Index="4073">The "Sunsweet" flower, hm? All right.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4074">I am going to begin my analysis of this specimen right
now. I'll let you know what I find.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4075">Good morning, &lt;playername&gt;. Could I bother you to
take a look at this?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4076">Good morning, &lt;playername&gt;. Could I bother you to
take a look at this?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4077">It's a Preserved Flower. I showed the Sunsweet Flower
you gave me to a friend, and he made this.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4078">To commemorate the creation of a brand-new product,
I thought I would give you the very first one.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Had you not found that flower, we never would have
thought to make something like this.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4079">When you finally find that special someone, wouldn't it be
wonderful to give this to them when you confess?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Just a thought. Well then, I'll be on my way.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4080">Uh-oh. It looks like your Bag can't hold any more tools.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Spare tools go in your Tool Box, so I'll just slip this in
there with them.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4081">Good morning, &lt;playername&gt;! I've done it!
I've finally done it!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4082">Good morning, &lt;playername&gt;! I've done it!
I've finally done it!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4083">Oh, er, sorry. Let me start from the beginning. I looked
into that flower you found, and it is indeed a new species.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4084">It gets better, too--just a little while ago, I finally
succeeded in making seeds from it!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4085">Since I was going to let you know of my discovery
anyway, I thought I'd bring you some Sunsweet Flower
Seeds, too.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I hope you will plant them and help spread this new
flower far and wide.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4086">Thank you!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4087">Like all seeds, these can only be grown in a certain
season. The Sunsweet Flower thrives in autumn.
Understood?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4088">Phew, it's been so long since I've felt this fired up about
my research. Plants are so fascinating!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4089">And it's all thanks to you, &lt;playername&gt;. I hope we
can get together and talk botany again sometime.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4090">And it's all thanks to you, &lt;playername&gt;. I hope we
can get together and talk botany again sometime.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4091">Hm? It looks like your Bag is full. There's no space for the
seeds there, so I'll just put them in your Tool Box.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4092">Ah! Hi, &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4093">Guess what? The flower we made bloom will now grow
here during this season aaall by itself!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4094">I just found this out myself. Isn't that so mysterious?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4095">I'm going to tell all the other Sprites about it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

floor 50 of a mine yet!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

  <Entry Index="4178">When I think about everyone in Mineral Town, and all
they've done for me, I feel like I should do something to
repay them.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's just...I never know what to say to them.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4179">They'd be happy to hear that.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4180">That's kinda lame.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4181">You think so...?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4182">Oh no, you think so?!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

town and everything...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4186">Oh, don't be so hard on yourself. Come with us, I insist.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Doubt yourself all you like, but I know a hard worker
when I see one.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="4187">Cliff's back in town, eh? I didn't know what to tell Ran
after he left... It's good to see him again.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
He's an honest kid. Be good to him, won't you?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
