  <Entry Index="7">All right! Time to enjoy this feast of mochi!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="8">My goodness! You all made so much mochi that we have
an abundance of leftovers.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You're welcome to bring some home with you.
Give them to people who couldn't make it here
today.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="9">&lt;playername&gt;, it seems your Bag is full.
What a shame...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="10">The mochi was so good! ♪ Phew. Man, I'm full.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="11">The mochi sure was delicious! ♪ But...I think I ate too much.
Ugh...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="12">The mochi sure was yummy! ♪ I even have some extras
to take back too. What a great day.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="13">Hey. You come to eat too? It's our one an' only mochi
event, after all. We gotta party!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="14">Freshly made mochi is something real special.
One bite and you'll be a fan for life.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="15">Yay, mochi! I LOVE fresh mochi.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="16">Hello, &lt;playername&gt;. Have you come to eat some
mochi too?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's one of my guilty pleasures. I might just help myself
to a few extras today...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="17">It's been some time since I've had mochi. I'll have to bring
some back home for Grandma too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="18">Fresh mochi is suuuper stretchy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="19">It's so easy to overindulge when it comes to mochi.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="20">Good evening, &lt;playername&gt;. Do you like mochi too?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I absolutely adore it. Though, if I eat too much, I know I'll
pay for it later.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But at least for today, I'll eat to my heart's content.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="21">Mochi is simply divine. I confess I'm quite fond of it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="22">Getting together to make mochi is one of my favorite
events. I come every year.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="23">It's been ages since I had mochi. You can't get it up on the
mountain.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

Do come and check things out tomorrow. Things will get
underway at 10:00 AM. I hope to see you there!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="33">I tend to get a little worked up over horse races,
but I can't help it. They're just so exciting!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="34">You entered the race, huh? Good luck! I'll be cheering
you on, so do your best.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="35">Did you buy any tickets? I bought a ton!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="36">I can't wait to see your race. Good luck!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="37">Gray wanted t'come, but as soon as Gramps found out,
he stopped him.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="38">Hey, you're gonna be in the saddle today, right? Good luck.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="39">I can't even imagine riding a horse. Everyone in the race
sure is brave.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="40">Try not to get hurt, okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="41">I know how to pick a winner, all right. My guesses are
almost always on the money. Lucky me! ♪&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="42">I expect great things outta you, so you better do
your best!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="43">I'm glad it's sunny today. And there's such a wonderful
breeze!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="44">Give it your best shot, now!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="45">Whenever this event comes around, I get so excited
I can't sleep a wink.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="46">If you're going to enter, you better aim for first place!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="47">Horses from Yodel Ranch are in the race too,
didja know? Other folks'll be riding them, though.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Seems like a lotta people participate in this event.
I even heard old Mugi used to race!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="48">Give it all you got! But not so much that you get hurt!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="49">Here you can buy tickets and exchange medals for prizes.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And if you want to start the race, just come and talk
to me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="50">Even those participating in the race can buy tickets.
Everyone just bets on themselves, though. Ho ho ho.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="51">Did you remember to buy some tickets? The mayor is
selling them if you're interested.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="52">I bet on you, so you had better win!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="53">I have the worst luck when it comes to horse racing.
I guess betting based on looks doesn't work.
But I don't know how else to pick a winner...
It's a festival, so you're supposed to have fun,
but it's just so frustrating!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="54">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;! I heard you're going to be
in the race. Naturally, I bet on you. Do your best 
to leave the competition in the dust! If someone
I knew were in every race, I'd never have to agonize
over who to bet on again. Oh, but I didn't put money
on you just because of that. I believe in your skills too,
of course.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="55">The races are also an opportunity to see the horses
everyone has raised. It's another reason I like this event.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="56">You're in the race, right? Good luck. I'll be rooting for you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="57">Horses are amazing creatures. I admire their
single-minded pursuit of victory as they race.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="58">I heard you entered the race. Believe in everything you've
done, and become one with your horse. Victory will follow.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="59">There're lots of horsies here.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="60">&lt;myhorsename&gt; is gonna run, right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="61">I always look forward to this event.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="62">Oh, so you're in today's race? Just relax. A calm spirit will
ride to victory.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="63">The races are officially over, and everyone's gone home.
What a marvelous day.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'll be staying behind to clean up, so if you want to
exchange medals for prizes, just come talk to me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="64">Do you want to exchange medals for prizes?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="65">Exchange medals</Entry>
  <Entry Index="66">Never mind</Entry>
  <Entry Index="67">You'd like to exchange some medals, yes?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="68">I'm afraid I can't give you any prizes while you're
carrying something.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="69">All finished?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="70">My, what a wonderful race.
Congratulations, &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="71">Hello, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
We're going to hold the Cooking Exhibition at 10:00 AM
in the Plaza tomorrow.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You can participate by bringing some of your own
culinary creations. I hope to see you there!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="72">Mom, you don't have to worry about it so much.
Don't overdo it, okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="73">What kind of food should I make? Hmmm...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="74">Yo, &lt;playername&gt;. You cookin' anythin' for the
exhibition?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If you are, it'd better be somethin' good.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Bon Vivant's the judge, after all. You won't be able t'win
with just any kinda food!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="75">I came because I heard Lillia was entering.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Now I'll be right on hand in case she needs emergency
treatment.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="76">The theme is a strange value
&lt;string0&gt;. It's not delicious at all.
Please report this bug.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="77">The theme of this exhibition is 'beverages.' I expect you all
to squeeze out some great flavors today.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Please prepare something in keeping with the theme.
I will only judge freshly prepared dishes.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="78">The theme of this exhibition is 'sweets.' I want treats

Please prepare something in keeping with the theme.
I will only judge freshly prepared dishes.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="82">Hmmm... What should I make?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="83">I wonder what the theme will be this time?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Well, Karen's going to enter no matter what it is...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="84">I'll win first place and show everyone just how good my
cooking is. My Inn's reputation is riding on this!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="85">I'm gonna do my best today.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="86">Today's exhibition will be simply scrumptious! I can't wait
to see what kinds of food will be featured.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Once you find out the theme from Bon Vivant, return
home and prepare a dish.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Even if you don't prepare anything, you can still watch
the event by returning here.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="87">Oh, you entered too? What are you going to make?
I can cook almost anything, but the more effort you put
into a dish, the better it tastes. Don't you think so?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="88">I love this festival. The marriage of cooking and
community is humbling to behold.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="89">I'm lookin' real forward to this. When this time of year
rolls around I get so excited I can hardly wait.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="90">I wonder if Mom'll be all right...
She was so enthusiastic, I couldn't stop her.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="91">My goodness! Such a large crowd of people makes this
very exciting, indeed. What fun!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="92">Lillia's food is amazin'. I've never tasted anythin' like it!
She's a real treasure, that woman.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="93">A menu that takes healthy foods into consideration
is best. Though, that's hard to do with just one dish.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="94">The fiery passion everyone shares for cooking is so
strong I can almost taste it!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="95">*sigh* I sure have a long way to go when it comes
to cooking...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="96">I've been trying to teach Karen how to cook,
but it's not going very well.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Why is she so adamant about entering the
Cooking Exhibition, I wonder?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="97">With today's line-up of entrants, I'll have to pull out all
the stops.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="98">Most of the food I make tends to be real simple stuff.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="99">&lt;playername&gt;, did you bring any food?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="100">Yes</Entry>
  <Entry Index="101">No</Entry>
  <Entry Index="102">It looks like you didn't bring a dish for this year's theme.
That's too bad.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="103">Then please place your entry on the table. The one Bon
Vivant deems most delicious will be crowned the winner.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Are you ready to start the judging?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="104">Yes</Entry>
  <Entry Index="105">No</Entry>
  <Entry Index="106">Excellent. Bon Vivant will now begin.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="107">Oh? Come talk to me again when you're ready
to begin, then.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="108">Then please sit back and enjoy the show. Are you ready
for the judging to begin?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="109">Are you ready for the judging to begin?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="110">Hmmm. I'm afraid we can't start the judging if you're
carrying something. Could you please put it away?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="111">My goal when I'm cooking is to create a homey, motherly
flavor. I've made these dishes a thousand times,
so I'm pretty confident.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="112">Many people bring food for the event, but they're all
so distinctive. It's easy to tell who made what.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="113">I eat my own terrible cookin' every single day, which is
why I really look forward to this event.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="114">This screen should show the bench and dishes.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
However, those cannot be displayed at the present time.
Apologies for the inconvenience.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="115">The Cooking Exhibition will now enter the judging stage!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Please come up when your name is called.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="116">Now then, first up is...Dudley!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="117">You've used a variety of ingredients, and blended them
together perfectly. Absolutely delectable!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="118">This smooth texture puts it in perfect harmony with the
caramel sauce.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's decadent and delicious.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="119">Freshly baked bread and spicy curry really rouses
the appetite. Mmmmm, wonderful!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="120">The more I eat this udon, the more bursting with energy
I become! What a treat!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="121">Fried rice may seem simple, but this dish has a lot
of depth.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's no easy feat to reach this level of perfection.
Quite the accomplishment.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="122">Next is Ran!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="123">Hmmm. Using milk makes the overall flavor
mild but very pleasant.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
This is a good dish.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="124">Yes... This has the perfect level of sweetness.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
People of all ages should be able to enjoy this.
It's delightful.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="125">The flavors of the ingredients harmonize with each other
very well. It has the perfect amount of sweetness.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="126">You've done well at bringing out the full flavor of the
udon and tempura. How very scrumptious.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="127">Mmmm, yes. Very good. The eggs and rice go well
together. Children would love this.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="128">Next is Lillia!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="129">This has a very fresh, fruity taste that cleanses
the palate. Well done.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="130">The entire cake is moist and has an exquisite flavor. &lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="131">The sweet and sour balance of the bread and the grapes
blends perfectly in the mouth.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
How delightful.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="132">The spiciness of the curry and the way the noodles slide
down the throat is just wonderful.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Mouth-wateringly good.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="133">There's a richness hidden amidst all the spice.
I'm impressed. This is very tasty.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="134">Next is Manna!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="135">You made a very palatable vegetable juice with a good
combination of ingredients. Marvelous.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="136">This entry has just the right touch of sweetness.
The texture is very smooth too. This is a quality dish.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="137">The balance of sweet and sour from the orange is great.
It goes well with the bread.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="138">Hmmm. A simple flavor that hides surprising depth.
This is delicious.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="139">The texture of the bamboo and the seasoning of the rice
are well-matched. An inspired pairing.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="140">Last is Karen!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="141">Next is Karen!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="142">Wh-What... What is this? I-I haven't the words to
describe what I've tasted here...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="143">I-Is this some kind of joke? I refrain from commenting.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="144">Hmmm... I can't quite find the words to express
this flavor.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="145">It has no body to it, so I don't feel like I've eaten anything.
Good...attempt.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="146">It's...onigiri. Plain onigiri. It's edible.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="147">Bon Vivant has tasted all of the contestants' entries.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
He will now decide the winner, so please give him
a moment.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="148">Last is &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="149">Th-This is...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="150">It tastes...extraordinary. Absolutely extraordinary!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Even some professionals could not bring out such flavor.
What a pleasant surprise!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="151">Delicious!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Have you considered becoming a chef? I can't remember
the last time I tasted something this good.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="152">Mmmm, yes. This is certainly some fine home cooking.
It's very good.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="153">Hmmm... It feels like...it might be missing something.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="154">I will refrain from commenting. Urp...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="155">This dish does not match the theme. You are disqualified!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="156">The winner will now be announced. Please come up when
your name is called. And the winner is...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="157">&lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="158">Dudley!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="159">Ran!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="160">Lillia!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="161">Manna!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="162">That was truly scrumptious. I congratulate you from the
bottom of my stomach.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="163">That was fun! It's about time I got back to work, though.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="164">Yo. Sorry t'bother you so early, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
We're havin' our grand Fetch Fest tomorrow, so I came
to invite you and your pet. Wanna join in?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="165">At the Fetch Fest, we have a disc tournament with our
pets. You gonna enter?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="166">Huh? Your pet's not fully grown yet? Too bad.
You can't join in, then.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Well, even if you can't participate, come on by and watch
if you're free.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The Fetch Fest'll be at the beach, 10:00 AM tomorrow.
Hope t'see you there!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="167">All right! I'll take them, then.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Don't worry. They're in good hands.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="168">Huh... Too bad. Well, come by to watch if you've got any
free time.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The Fetch Fest'll be at the beach, 10:00 AM tomorrow.
Hope t'see you there.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="169">Hee hee! All the pets are sooo cute! ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="170">You're participating, right? Good luck!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="171">Pets are really smart. I wouldn't mind having one at
home, myself.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="172">You entered?
Wow. Good luck out there.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="173">Some animals are quite clever, especially pets. If you
train them, they can do lots of different things.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Hmmm. Maybe we should get a pet, too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="174">You're taking part, right? Do your best!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="175">I've always been particularly fond of this holiday.
Watching everyone's pets chase the disc with all their
might is so charming.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="176">Oh, you're joining in? Wonderful. I'll be cheering you on.
Good luck.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="177">I was wondering what all the ruckus was
outside the Cafe. A fetch contest, huh?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
So it's a tournament where pets compete to catch a
flying disc. Neat!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="178">Oh, you've entered, huh? Well, I'll be watching, then.
Do your best, you hear?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="179">Ever since I started the tournament, the Fetch Fest's
been somethin' I look forward to every year.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I know all the pets that've entered.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
My work as a shipper has me go to a buncha houses,
after all. I'll be happy no matter who wins.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="180">Go for first place! You got this!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="184">All right! Let's get this show on the road!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="185">Okay. When you're good to go, just lemme know.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="186">The Fetch Fest was a huge success.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="187">The Fetch Fest is now over.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Contest organizers will bring the entered pets back to
their homes, so owners should go on ahead and return.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I repeat, the Fetch Fest is now over.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="188">Awww. You were sooooo close. I hope you win next year!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="189">Woohoo! Awesome! You won! ♪&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="190">The pets were all super cuuute! ∀ I want one too!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="191">That was so close. I think even just participating is
pretty amazing, though.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="192">Congratulations! Just what I'd expect from someone who
works on a farm. You've got a real way with animals.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="193">Animals really are clever. I'm even more sure of that now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="194">That's too bad. I'm sure you'll win next year if you work
hard, though. Don't let it get you down.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="195">My goodness! What a victory. I'm as happy as if I'd won
myself.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="196">After watching that performance, I'm really impressed
with all of the animals. Maybe we should seriously
consider getting a pet...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="197">Oh no! That's a shame. But your pet did their very best,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="198">Congratulations, &lt;playername&gt;! I had a hunch that
you'd win.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="199">What fun that was. Our community spirit always shines
brightly on festivals like this.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="200">Hey, too bad, huh? But don't let it bother you. Just give it
another go next year.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="201">After seeing you in action, you totally deserved it.
Congrats on your win!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="202">Did you see that? Amazing, right?! Pets sure can do all
kinds of things.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="203">Well, don't be discouraged. You should try again next
year. I'll be rootin' for ya.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="204">Great job! You musta practiced a lot, huh?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Join in again next year and get a winnin' streak going.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="205">This year was a blast again. You should join in next year.
I'll root for ya.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="206">Listen up, everyone! The champion of this year's Fetch
Fest is &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It was a total victory! Good work, you two!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

by the Plaza. I promise it'll be fun.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="221">Great! Then I'll take &lt;string0&gt; now
and look after her until the festival's over.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
The Cluck-Cluck Clash is tomorrow morning at 10:00 AM,
so don't miss it!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="222">If you're confident about winning, you miiight want to
leave some space in your Bag.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
We can't give you a trophy if your Bag's full,

  <Entry Index="223">Let the feathers fly!</Entry>
  <Entry Index="224">Not yet.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="225">Ah, I'm afraid you can't use anything to help your chicken.
Any items you're holding should be put away.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="226">All right! Release...the chickens!!!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="227">Okay. When you're ready, just talk to me and we'll begin.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="228">Oh, you're participating? That's great! This festival's
really funny!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="229">Chickens are sooo cute!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="230">This is a festival I look forward to every year.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="231">If you're going to enter, then I eggs-pect you
to do your best.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...I've been waiting all year to use that pun.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="232">I'll be watching the festival from here.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="233">Hello, &lt;playername&gt;. Good luck out there.
May your chicken be ruler of the roost.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="234">Oh, if it isn't &lt;playername&gt;. The Cluck-Cluck Clash
is a proper tournament, you know. We take it very
seriously.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="235">I wish you luck in the battle ahead.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="236">Don't you think we could learn a thing or two from the
way the chickens fight with all their might? What noble
birds.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="237">I'm going to watch those chickens. Watch and learn. &lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="238">The Cluck-Cluck Clash is a real hoot. Or should I say
"cluck"?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="239">Are your farm's chickens strong, &lt;playername&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="240">This year's battle of the birds had a lot of highlights.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="241">Hey, &lt;string0&gt; is really strong.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="242">That's too bad. But there's no room for paltry poultry at
this festival.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="243">That was so much fun. Chickens are adorable! ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="244">Wooow! Good for you. Maybe it'll start laying Golden
Eggs soon.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="245">Aww, that was close, huh? When that happens, there's
just not much you can do about it, though. Cheer up!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="246">So that chicken won, after all. Just as I thought.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="247">I knew your chicken would make it far!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
How did I know, you ask? Because it lays delicious
eggs, of course!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="248">Huh. Was it not feeling well? That was the most
powerful bird on the farm, right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="249">What a fabulous contest. Truly inspiring. You should have
participated, &lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="250">Well done! You should have &lt;string0&gt;
participate again next year.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="251">This year's festival was amazing.
There's nothing quite like pitting chickens
against one another in a bid for glory.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="252">Phew. I got tired just watching them.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="253">Hey, hey, hey! That's phenomenal! You must be proud
to have such a fine feathered friend.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="254">What a shame... Perhaps it would perform better if you
gave it a bit more attention.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="255">The feathers were flying, the beaks were snapping,
and I've never heard such a ruckus! I had a rip-roaring
time.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="256">Of course you're proud.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="257">Mmm, you did your best.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="258">Hmmm... That was quite the clash. Yes, indeedy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="259">Those chickens gave their all. I enjoyed watching it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="260">Is your chicken all right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="261">The Cluck-Cluck Clash is now over.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Festival organizers will bring the entered chickens back
to their homes, so owners should go on ahead and return.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I repeat, the Cluck-Cluck Clash is now over.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="262">Congratulations on winning!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
That was impressive. There aren't many people
who could raise such powerful poultry.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It was a great match.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="263">Good morning, &lt;playername&gt;. We're holding our
annual Moo-Moo Festival tomorrow.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Any adult cow can participate as long as it's not
pregnant.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm hoping &lt;myfarmname&gt; can participate next year,
but come watch if you like.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It'll start 10:00 AM sharp at Rose Plaza. Hope to see you
there tomorrow, &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="264">Good morning, &lt;playername&gt;. We're holding our

By next year, &lt;myfarmname&gt;'s animals should be old
enough to participate, but come watch if you like.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It'll start 10:00 AM sharp at Rose Plaza. Hope to see you
there tomorrow, &lt;playername&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="265">Good morning, &lt;playername&gt;. The Moo-Moo Festival
is tomorrow at Rose Plaza. Pretty exciting, right?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
What do you think about entering an adult cow from
&lt;myfarmname&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="266">Enter</Entry>
  <Entry Index="267">Don't enter</Entry>
  <Entry Index="268">Then which cow will you enter?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Any cow that's producing milk is fine, but pregnant cows
aren't allowed.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="269">That's too bad. I thought it would be more exciting to
have a cow from your farm join in too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="270">We'll be putting on the Moo-Moo Festival at the Plaza
tomorrow. Come watch, if you'd like.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Any adult cow can be entered if it's not pregnant, but...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...it doesn't look like you have any cows that can
participate.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Well, catch you later, &lt;playername&gt;.
Hope to see you tomorrow.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="271">Okey-doke. Then I'll take &lt;string0&gt;
with me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="272">These are some fine cows. They're all pretty cute.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="273">Hey, is a cow from your farm participating,
&lt;playername&gt;? Good luck! I hope you win.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="274">Hey, is a cow from your farm participating,
&lt;playername&gt;? Good luck! I hope you win.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="275">A cow from our farm is participating, right,
&lt;nickname&gt;? We're bound to win! I'll be rooting
from the sidelines!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="276">I finally started to be able to stomach milk recently.
I used to hate it, but it tastes good now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="277">I hope you win!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="278">Your cow's just gotta win, &lt;nickname&gt;. Good luck!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="279">Hey, &lt;nickname&gt;. You should drink milk every day,
you know. It's good for your health.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="280">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;. You should drink milk every day,
you know. It's good for your health.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="281">Oh, so your cow is participating too.
Do you think you'll win?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="282">Hey, your cow is participating too, right,
&lt;nickname&gt;? I'll be cheering you on.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="283">There, there. Good girl. Ah ha ha ha, I love nature.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="284">The cow from your farm looks splendid,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="285">The cow from your farm looks splendid,
&lt;playername&gt;.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="286">It's so wonderful to have a chance to interact with
animals from a young age.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Some kids have never even touched a dog or cat before
because their parents hate animals.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="287">I'll be cheering you on. Good luck.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="288">I'll be cheering you on, &lt;nickname&gt;. Good luck.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="289">Hmmm. They all look very robust. Which cow do you think
is the best?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="290">I'm so glad you entered. I can't wait to see
your cow in action.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="291">Hee hee, they're all so cute. The way they just stare into
space while they're eating is adorable.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="292">Your cow will do just fine. It's sure to win.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="293">Wooow, they're so big! Would I be flattened like
a pancake if one stepped on me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="294">Your cow looks real strong.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="295">Your cow looks real strong.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="296">Cows are treated very differently depending on what
country you live in.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But they're hard workers and produce milk, so they're
generally appreciated.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="297">Are you taking good care of your cow?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If you don't shower it with love, it won't become the best
cow it can be.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="298">The cows from our ranch aren't gonna join in.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
When I asked why, Grandpa said something about
"imparshality."&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="299">A cow from your farm is gonna be in it, yeah?
I'll cheer for you!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="300">A cow from your farm is gonna be in it, yeah?
I'll cheer for you!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="301">Cows, hmm? I came because I thought they might give me
some new kind of inspiration.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And, indeed... Their slab-like design, the roughness of their
hide, their spotty coloring, their empty eyes... Fascinating!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="302">I think it's about time we crowned the winning cow.
Ah, but a word of advice: be sure to leave some space
in your Bag!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
After all, if you've got a full Bag and your cow is the
victor, we won't be able to give you your trophy.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Now, then, are you ready?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="303">Start the judging.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="304">Then we'll get going.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="305">Talk to me when you're ready to begin, then.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="306">The Moo-Moo Festival is now over.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Festival organizers will bring the entered cows back to
their homes, so owners should go on ahead and return.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I repeat, the Moo-Moo Festival is now over.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="307">I knew that cow would win. I could see the determination
in its eyes.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="308">Your cow had a different look in its eyes. I really thought
it would win.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="309">Can't win 'em all. You should try again next year.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="310">They're all sooo adorable! ♪&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="311">Congrats! ♪ I knew you'd win.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
How'd I know? Oh, I just kinda had a hunch.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="312">Awww, that's sad. But &lt;string0&gt; did
her best.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="313">If a cow steps on your foot, don't try to force it off.
You might break a bone.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="314">&lt;string0&gt;'s milk seems to have a lot
of nutrients. Would you let me try some sometime?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="315">That's unfortunate. &lt;string0&gt;'s coat
seems quite nice, though, so I'm sure it'll win next year.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="316">Ha ha ha ha! It licked my whole face. I'm all slimy now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="317">It was quite the feat to edge out those other cows.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="318">Participating is what's most important, so don't be so
discouraged.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="319">It was so happy when I brushed it. That made me happy
too. What a fun day.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="320">Congratulations! &lt;myfarmname&gt; sure produces some
real winners.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="321">All the cows here today were incredible. I think you did
a great job.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="322">What a marvelous showcase we had today. It was a good
opportunity to see a lot of other cows, wasn't it?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="323">Congratulations on winning! I feel so proud to be a part
of this town.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="324">Don't fret, &lt;playername&gt;. It was a close competition.
Don't be discouraged from entering again next year.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="325">Ugh. Yu, that little troublemaker... He causes mischief no
matter where we go.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="326">Congratulations. All the love and care you gave it really
showed.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="327">Oh, so you didn't win. If you give it love and care every
day, I'm sure you'll win next year.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="328">I tried to ride on a cow, but Elly got mad at me.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I just wanted to talk with it, though...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="329">Wow! You won! Congrats! Lemme ride the winning cow
sometime!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="330">Wow! You won! Congrats! Lemme ride the winning cow
sometime!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="331">Awww, your cow lost. It's okay, though. I'm sure it'll win
next year.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="332">Awww, your cow lost. It's okay, though. I'm sure it'll win
next year.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="333">My dream is to sleep while reclining on a cow.
With a straw hat covering my face, of course.
Ah, sweet bovine bliss.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="334">So you won. Congratulations! I praise your efforts.&lt;wait&gt;
</Entry>
  <Entry Index="335">That's unfortunate. I prayed for your victory, but...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="336">Cows are nice.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="337">Wow! Good job! I'm so happy for you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="338">Wow! Good job! I'm so happy for you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="342">Be sure to keep taking good care of your animals.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="343">Hrmmm. Well, that's disappointing.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="344">All of the cows have such fascinating patterns.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="345">You won? Congratulations. I don't know what criteria
they used, but personally, I think your cow is a wonderful
specimen.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="346">You lost? You must be terribly disappointed.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="347">And so, the winner is...
&lt;myfarmname&gt;'s &lt;string0&gt;!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Its coat is glossy, and it's a very amiable cow. Well done!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="348">Man, this year's Fireworks Festival is really something.
The big displays are nice, and I really like the sparklers
too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="349">Dude, fireworks are so exciting! I'm a positive guy to
begin with, but the Fireworks Festival REALLY puts me
in a great mood!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="350">The boom of the fireworks is so loud that I can feel it
echoing in my chest.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="351">Wow...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="352">Fireworks come in little tubes, but when you shoot 'em,
they explode into all these big shapes and colors.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I wonder how they work.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="353">Isn't it wonderful how one can simply turn off one's
brain and enjoy the spectacle of fireworks against
the night sky?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
What a luxury it is to enjoy a thing of beauty simply
for itself.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="354">Aah...! Glittering flowers of light filling the sky from end
to end... The pyrotechnicians have created true art.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="355">I love how fireworks just pop and change, and then
BOOM! They fade so fast you can't tear your eyes away.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="356">I wonder how fireworks can have all those different
colors inside those little tubes.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
And why do they always seem to be the same shape,
no matter where I look at them from?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="357">One night a year, the sky goes from dark to bursting with
light and sound.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I wonder what all the sea creatures think of it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="358">Another town I lived in had lots of fireworks displays.
Parades, New Year's, festivals... It was always going
boom, boom, boom!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Of all the fireworks I've seen, I think the ones from this
shoreline are the prettiest, though.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="359">How beautiful... When I was little I was afraid
of fireworks. I don't remember why, but I thought
they were scary back then.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I think it was because it felt like they were falling
towards me. Don't you get that feeling when you
look at them?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="360">A grand pulse of man-made energy and sound that shakes
you down to your very soul.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's an experience one can have only on a night like this.
Isn't it splendiferous?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="361">This year's Fireworks Festival was great. Let's come
and watch it again next year.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="362">Aw, over already?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="363">I had a blast! I definitely have to come see this again
next year!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="364">Welp, that's it. It's over. I hope we can watch it together
again next year.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="365">That's it, I guess. And the next one isn't till next year.
It's gonna be hard to wait that long, huh?&lt;wait&gt; </Entry>
  <Entry Index="366">Bravo! What a wonderful display that was! I haven't the
words to describe how much I enjoyed it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="367">I think I'd like to make a piece someday that expresses
the emotions I experienced tonight.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="368">Wasn't the finale amazing? I could hear everyone ooh-ing
and aah-ing.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="369">Aww, it's over. I'd love to sit and just bask in how much
fun it all was, but I guess we'd better go home.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="370">Ahahaha... I was looking up for so long that I got a crick
in my neck. Ouch. I think I'd better go home and rest.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="371">That was really fun. Let's watch it together again
next year.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="372">Ahhh, that was great. Now that I've had this nice break,
I feel recharged. I'll be ready to give my best at work
again tomorrow!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="373">That was an entirely satisfactory evening. I will sleep
well tonight under a blanket of stars.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="374">Watching fireworks from the beach is the best.
It just feels so magical.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

When I was little, my whole family would come, and we'd
make a day out of it. Back then it all seemed so much
bigger to me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="378">The show's about to start. Do you need something?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="379">Should I invite them to watch the
Fireworks Festival with me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="380">Yes</Entry>

That sounds great.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="383">&lt;nickname&gt;, you came. How about we sit and
watch the fireworks together?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="384">Oh! Hi, &lt;playername&gt;! I've been looking forward to

Exciting!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="388">Oh! Hi, &lt;nickname&gt;! ∀ The fireworks are gonna
start soon.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="389">I can't wait for the show to start.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I like fireworks a lot. My old hometown used to have
these kinds of displays.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="390">I'm really starting to get excited now... I hope the show
kicks off soon.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="391">Huh? You want to watch the Fireworks Festival with

  <Entry Index="392">Oh, hey. &lt;nickname&gt;, look. The view from here

with me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="393">Ah, hello, &lt;playername&gt;. You came to watch too?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Mineral Town's Fireworks Festival is particularly
lovely. I suggest you get comfortable and prepare
to be wowed.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="394">It ought to begin shortly. Get ready,
&lt;playername&gt;. You're in for a real treat.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="395">You'd like to watch the Fireworks Festival with me?
Of course. I don't mind at all.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="396">Ah, &lt;nickname&gt;. You've come too? Come.
Let's enjoy the show together.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="397">Nothing like relaxing on a summer's night with a glass

  <Entry Index="398">*giggle* Summer's just the best. There's the Fireworks
Festival to look forward to, and lots of good food, too!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="399">What's up? Looking for someone to watch the Fireworks
Festival with?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="400">Sure! I'd love to watch it with you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="401">Oh, hey, &lt;nickname&gt;. All done with work
for the day?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="402">Great! We can watch the fireworks together.
Here, sit next to me. C'mon, scooch a little closer.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="403">Woohoo! The fireworks show is gonna be great!
They always set off a whole bunch at once at
the end. It's gonna be amazing!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="404">Do you know where you wanna sit to watch
the fireworks? It'll be a waste if you don't find
just the right spot.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="405">Oh, c'mon. You don't have to be so formal about it.
I'd love to watch the fireworks with you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="406">&lt;nickname&gt;! It's about time you got here.
Hurry, they're about to start!
C'mon, we can watch from here.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="407">Good evening. I think the fireworks display
is about to begin.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="408">I wonder what kind of show they're going to put on for us
this year? I can't wait to find out.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="409">Yes, of course. I'd love to watch the fireworks together.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="410">Oh, there you are, &lt;nickname&gt;. Let's watch the
fireworks together.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="411">Good evening, &lt;playername&gt;. I'm so glad you made it

  <Entry Index="413">I think it ought to start soon. Is something the matter?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="414">You want to watch the fireworks show together?
Of course. I'd love to.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="415">Oh! &lt;nickname&gt;, you came. I thought you were too
busy with work to make it. I'm so glad.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="416">Wonderful. We can watch the fireworks together,
after all.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="417">Nothing says summer like fireworks on the beach. They
hold this festival every year, but I never get tired of it.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
This town puts on a way better show than a lot of other
places I know.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="418">Hey, &lt;playername&gt;? You sure you wanna watch from
there? You've gotta find just the right spot for this kind
of thing, y'know.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="420">&lt;nickname&gt;, what're you waiting for? C'mon, we'll
watch them from here. Hurry up before they start!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="421">Every year, Grandpa makes the cylinders used for
the fireworks.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
There's no way to see them from here, but every year
he tells me to watch them closely. I don't get it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="422">Isn't it time for them to start yet? Y'know, I don't think
I've met a single person who hates fireworks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="423">Hm? O-Oh, uh, sure. We can watch the fireworks
together if you want.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="424">&lt;nickname&gt;, c'mon. It's about to start. I've been
waiting all day for this.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="425">I have been awaiting tonight's events with great
anticipation for days now.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Has it not begun yet? When will the display get
underway?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="426">&lt;playername&gt;, how long are you going to aimlessly
wander about? Best choose your spot before the glorious
view escapes you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="427">You'd like to watch them from here? Oh, er...all right.
I don't particularly mind, I suppose.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="428">&lt;nickname&gt;, you're here. Splendid. Let us soak in
the dazzling display from here.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="429">Oh, good evening. The sky is beautiful tonight, no?
So crisp and clear. We should have a lovely show.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="430">I can feel everyone's positive energies growing with
anticipation. I believe the show will be starting soon.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="431">Watching the fireworks display together with another...
Hmm. All right. That may be a source of positive energies.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="432">My, did you sense my feelings calling out to you?
I was just thinking I might like some company.
Come, let's watch together.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="433">Good morning, &lt;playername&gt;. We plan to hold our
annual Concert in the Church tomorrow at 6:00 PM.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I came today because I'd like you to participate as
a performer. Will you join us?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="436">Don't participate</Entry>
  <Entry Index="437">You will? Wonderful. I prayed you would.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm thinking of having you play the ocarina. I'll give the
instrument to you tomorrow.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="438">Please don't be late tomorrow. Come to the Church
at 6:00 PM.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="439">I understand. It's a shame, but you'll still be able to hear
Karen's beautiful singing voice if you attend.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
If you have time, do come see us perform at the Church.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="440">I've been waiting for you. Everyone's inside.
Now let's go in.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="441">Forgive me, but we're about to have a concert,
so no outside items are allowed in the Church.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm terribly sorry, but could you set what you're holding
aside?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="442">This is great. Music is perfect for relaxing.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="443">La la la ♪ Laaa la la ♪ Yeah, all right. I'm ready to sing.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="444">Everyone helps put this concert together. It's more fun
than having professionals come.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="445">Even if I mess up, I'm sure Elly'll help back me up.
I'll just wing it. ♪&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="446">I'll be playing the organ today. Though, I'm not very
experienced. I only took a few lessons when I was
younger.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="447">Phew, I'm so nervous. I wonder if I'll be able to play
without making any mistakes?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="448">Karen's gonna sing. She's so cool!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="449">I was going to have you play the ocarina, correct?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm looking forward to it. Shall we begin?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="450">Begin</Entry>
  <Entry Index="451">Wait</Entry>
  <Entry Index="452">Now then, ladies and gentlemen. Please wait a moment
while they take their places.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="453">All right. Once you're ready, come talk to me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="454">Hmm. It will be quite difficult to play properly while
carrying something. Please put it away.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="455">You're not participating in this concert, correct?
Then please observe. I'm sure you will find it
very moving.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="456">I wanna sing in the Concert when I grow up.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="457">I really enjoyed that. I should come again next year.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="458">What a wonderful event. I can't wait till next year's.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="459">Good morning, &lt;playername&gt;. Everyone will be
gathering at 10:00 AM tomorrow for the
Harvest Festival.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
For this event, we all bring ingredients to throw into a
big pot. It's a kind of community potluck.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It would be wonderful if you could bring something
delicious to contribute too. I hope to see you tomorrow!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="460">I brought something! Boy, is everyone gonna be surprised.
Hee hee!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="461">See? Jam. I'm sure it'll help give it that extra kick.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="462">I'll have to keep a close eye on Karen.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
One time she threw chocolate in.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="463">All right, don't touch the pot! Hey, don't put that
stuff in yet!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Ugh, that's not what the fish is for!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="464">Argh! Enough! Quit yelling, Dad! It's all the same when
it's mixed up!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="465">Oh my. I think people might be sneaking things in without
others knowing.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="466">It'll be nice not having to cook for a change. And tonight
we'll make our own hot pot with whatever's left over at
home.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="467">Hrmm. It seems you haven't brought anything for the pot.
If you want to participate, could you bring some kind of
food?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="468">Hello, &lt;playername&gt;. Did you bring an ingredient to
add to the pot?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="469">Yes</Entry>
  <Entry Index="470">No</Entry>
  <Entry Index="471">You'd like to add that, yes? Excellent. Let's get it in there
and start the feast.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="472">...Is this some kind of joke? We can't put that in the pot.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="473">Hot pots are really good for you. Soup has a lot of
nutrients, you know.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'll have to bring some back for Grandma.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="474">Hot pots are really good for you. Soup has a lot nutrients,
you know.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'll have to bring some back for Grandma.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="475">Oh, &lt;playername&gt;. Did you bring something good?
You do run a farm, after all. I have high hopes for your
contribution.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="476">Ah, sweet sermons, this takes me back. I used to do
something similar back in the day.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I would put on my holy apron and make the most divine
soup, then have the townspeople over.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="477">Man, that looks good. Sittin' down and havin' a meal with
so many people is always a great time too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="478">I-It wasn't me, okay? I didn't do it. The pot is jam-free,
I swear!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="479">I...may have dropped the jam in. And the jar. 
I fished it out before anyone noticed, though.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="480">*sigh* I'm sure we have Karen to thank for this...again.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Maybe it was candy this time. Or marshmallows?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="481">Phew, that's a relief. It seems nothing strange made it in
this time.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="482">That's odd. I tasted it partway through and...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="483">Obviously, it turned out amazing because I was the one
watching the pot.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="484">Awww, I was really looking forward to it too.
I'm not even close to full yet!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="485">Uuuuugh... I ate too much.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="486">*sigh* I knew it. We should have checked each ingredient
before it went in. What a waste of food...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="487">Now that was a feast. We must be grateful for the
blessings of the land and sea.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="488">What in the world...? Just what kind of flavor IS this?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="489">That was absolutely delicious. Oh my...
There isn't any left.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="490">Well, we all make it together, after all.
This does happen sometimes.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="491">Did you have fun? Eating together with so many people
is quite the experience, right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="492">Hmm? Why is everyone upset? I thought it was good.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="493">The fish stock was perfect. It really made the dish
for me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="494">&lt;playername&gt;, do you have some water?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="495">Anna threw in those herbs.
They did a great job canceling out the fishy smell.
Though, the fragrance might be a little too strong.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="496">Well, this is part of having everyone bring ingredients.
Unpredictability is the cross we all must bear.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="497">Hot pots certainly taste better when you share them
with everyone.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="498">No matter what it tastes like, I can't bring myself
to waste any.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Why? Because it's hurtful to the mountain, ocean, and
the people who made it. You make sure to eat some too,
you hear?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="499">Well now, I've had my meal, and it was a real treat.
Time to get back to swingin' my axe!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="500">There's supposed to be a large pot and things displayed
for this event.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But those can't be displayed at the present time.
Apologies for the inconvenience.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="501">Boy, the moon sure is pretty.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="502">It really is beautiful.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="503">Whoa, this place has the best view.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="504">Wow. The moon looks huge tonight.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="505">Aah, what a lovely moon.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="506">The pearly brilliance of the moon's light suffusing the
night sky with a gentle glow... What sublime beauty.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="507">The moon seems so close it feels like I could almost reach
out and touch it. We definitely picked the right spot.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="508">Wow... Right now, people all over the world are looking up
at the moon, just like us.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="509">Man, now that's one huge moon! They say there's a
rabbit living up there, you know. I wonder if that's true.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="510">Of all the phases of the moon, it's the coolest when
it's full. That's when it shows us its true face.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="511">There's something mystical about the moon this evening.
It's the same moon as always, but somehow tonight is
special.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="512">Tonight, we see the moon as a perfect circle. The other
phases all have their charms, but the full moon is special...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="513">Ooh! Moon dumplings. Mind if I have some?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Woohoo! Thanks! *munch* *munch* *munch*&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="514">Mmmmm! Thanks! Those were really good.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="515">Oh...moon dumplings? Did you make these just for me?
O-Oh, um, th-thank you...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I-Is it okay if I taste one? Thanks... *munch* *munch*
*munch*&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="516">Mmm. Those were great. Eating moon dumplings while
watching the moon... It really makes tonight something
special.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="517">What, you made moon dumplings for me? Aww, thanks!
That's so cool of you!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Heh heh, don't mind if I do! *munch* *munch* *munch*&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="518">Mmm! Those really hit the spot. Man, getting to have
tasty moon dumplings while watching the moon is the
way to go. Thanks!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="519">Huh? Oh, moon dumplings. You made these for me?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Thanks. *munch* *munch* *munch*&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="520">Yum. Those were pretty good. Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="521">Oh ho! Moon dumplings! Did you make them especially for
tonight? How very thoughtful.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Why, thank you. *munch* *munch* *munch*&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="522">Mmm. They were absolutely delicious. Thank you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="523">And those are...? Ah, I see. "Moon dumplings."
How fanciful.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
What, I'm to eat these? ...I suppose I could try one.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="524">Well, color me surprised. They're quite good. Still, eating
dumplings while observing the moon? What an unusual
custom.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="525">I wonder if Mom and Dad used to come and watch the
moon like this. I wish... I wish he'd come home soon.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="526">Looking up at the moon on a night like this puts you
in a mood that's hard to describe... Or is it just me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="527">The moon's pretty impressive as-is, but I think it's even
cooler-looking with wisps of cloud floating across it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="528">I don't usually bother staring at the moon, but taking
some time to relax and give it a look ain't half bad.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="529">I could gaze at the moon like this all night long. Let's hope
we're blessed with good weather again next year.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="530">Which do you prefer, the full moon or the shifting phases
of waxing and waning?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
No, never mind. The beauteous faces of the moon are
something that just cannot be compared.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="531">Staying up late isn't so bad every once in a while.
I hope I can make it till dawn, though...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="532">Whoops! I stayed up all night. I hope my eyes don't get
too puffy...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="533">It's so pretty...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="534">Wooow. The moon is super round. And huge!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="535">Ooh, it's so beautiful.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="536">Beautiful...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="537">It's really pretty.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="538">On a night like tonight I can feel the tug of the moon's
natural energies...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="539">Isn't this the best? You won't find a better view than
from here.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="540">Boy, it looks really, REALLY big from here.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="541">Y'know what? It's so round that it looks like a big ol' ball.
Or a dumpling. Mmmmm...dumplings.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="542">The moon truly is a strange and mystic thing.
Sometimes, I wonder...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Without the moon, what would the world be like?
Some place entirely different, I'm sure.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="543">I really love the moon. You've seen it when it's all wispy
and white in the morning, right? It's awfully cute
then too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="544">I can feel the moon's pure energies suffusing my very
soul... Can you feel it too?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="545">It's weird. How come the moon looks so
beautiful? It's just the same old moon, right?
Why's it different this one night?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="546">It feels like we're on a totally different world sitting
under this moon.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="547">If I jump, I think I could just about reach it. Look, see?
I can almost touch it right now.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="548">Mama and Papa said they'd be coming out tonight too.
I wonder if they found a different spot to sit.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Actually, it might just be Papa. Mama doesn't like the
mountain at night.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="549">The moon is so bright it's almost as light as day.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
On nights like this, don't you just want to stay up
all night long?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="550">It's said the pure energies of the moon can have great
and mystical effects on both humans and nature.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Looking up at the moon tonight, I think I can
understand why.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="551">Ooh! Moon dumplings! And they look so soft and squishy!
Did you make them just for tonight?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Awesome, thanks so much! *munch* *munch* *munch*&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="558">Those were delicious. Thank you. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="559">Oh, moon dumplings! I tried to make some today too, but
they didn't come out very well. Hm? They're for me?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Oh, thank you! *munch* *munch* *munch*&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="560">Mmmmm, so tasty. I'm so glad I got to eat these tonight.
Thank you. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="561">Ah, moon dumplings. The perfect accompaniment for
a night like this. Oh? They're for me? How considerate
of you.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I think I'll have one right now, then. *munch* *munch*
*munch*&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="562">Yes, quite delicious. Thank you, &lt;nickname&gt;. ∀&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="563">What lovely weather we're having today. And just look at
all the pretty horses!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="564">Oh, you're going to ride in today's race? How wonderful.
I'll be cheering for you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="565">So Gray got t'come this time, eh? Good, good. His gramps
wouldn't let him come back in spring, so I'm happy for 'im.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="566">Yo. You're in today's race, right? Good luck out there.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="567">Miss Lillia wanted to see the horses, so I came along just
in case.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It wouldn't do if her health took a turn for the worse.
I'm hoping some fresh air will help her feel better.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="568">It's all well and good to give it your best and have fun,
but please be very careful not to get hurt.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="569">I think I'll buy a race ticket this time. Hmm, I wonder
which horse I should pick.&lt;wait&gt; </Entry>
  <Entry Index="570">Good luck. I'll be cheering you on from the sidelines.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="571">Oh my! Look at all the horses. What beautiful animals.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="572">I hear you entered the race. Good luck!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="573">It seems like it would be quite pleasant to ride a horse.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="574">You entered today's race, yes? I shall pray for
your victory.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="575">Grandpa gave me permission to take some time off and
come today. I'm gonna head right over and buy a ticket.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="576">Whoa. You're riding in the race? All right! I know who
I'm puttin' my money on!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="577">Horse races are fun to watch, ain't they?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="578">I'm bettin' on you, kid. Good luck!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

What do you think about entering an adult sheep, alpaca,
or Angora rabbit from &lt;myfarmname&gt;?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="582">Great! Then which animal will you be entering?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Any adult animal is fine as long as it's not pregnant.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="583">That's too bad. The event would be a lot more fun if we
had an animal from your farm.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="584">We're holding the Fluffy Festival in the Plaza tomorrow.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Any adult sheep can participate if it's not pregnant and
still has its wool, but...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...it doesn't look like you have any sheep that
can participate.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Well, goodbye, &lt;playername&gt;. I hope you'll still

  <Entry Index="612">I think it's about time to crown the winning animal.
Ah, but a word of advice: be sure to leave some space
in your Bag!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
After all, if you've got a full Bag and your animal is the
victor, we won't be able to give you your trophy.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Now, then, are you ready?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="613">The Fluffy Festival is now over.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Festival organizers will bring the entered animals back
to their homes, so owners should go on ahead and return.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I repeat, the Fluffy Festival is now over.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="614">I knew that animal would win. Its coat was flawless.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

some of that fluff with me? It looks perfect for keepin'
warm in winter.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="637">So your animal ended up losin', huh? Well, don't get too
down about it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="638">I wanted to enter my favorite fluffy animal friend,

  <Entry Index="645">Well, that's too bad. You keep at it, and do your best for
next year's festival. I'm sure the result'll be better.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="646">When I get close to try and FEEL the animals,
I get all sleepy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="647">Congratulations on winning! It was all thanks to the
energy I sent your way, I'm sure.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I'm kidding. It shows just how hard you've worked to
reach this point. Well done.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="648">You lost, hm? Come now, if you get all sad, the animals will
get depressed too. Chin up.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="649">And so, the winner is...&lt;myfarmname&gt;'s

I was actually wondering what you'd be doing for tonight
too, seeing as you live alone and stuff.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Starlight Night is just better spent together with friends

  <Entry Index="750">So yeah. Today I get to spend together with my family

  <Entry Index="787">Guess what, guess what! My mattress is stuffed full of
sheep wool!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="788">Really...? Do you feel the sheep's energies emanating

on it?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

just NNNMMMMM!!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

great views? It's Starlight Night, so let's go and look at
the stars.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="826">It's called Starlight Night, so the party can't be over till
we see some stars, right?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Then let's go up the mountain! The weather's great,
so I'm sure the view'll be totally awesome!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="827">Oh... I almost forgot. Um, do you want to go up the
mountain and look at the stars?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="828">So where's the best place to see the stars?
Top of the mountain, I bet.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's Starlight Night and all, so why don't we go out
and check 'em out?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="829">Ah, I know! What say we go and view the stars?
Missing sleep isn't healthy, but it'd be a waste not
to on Starlight Night.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="830">I hear the stars are particularly lovely this night.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Would you like to go with me up the mountain

  <Entry Index="834">But first...here. Starlight Night present.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="835">Oh yes. I almost forgot. This is for you.
A Starlight Night present, yes?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="836">Goodness me, I almost forgot. This is for you.
I have prepared a gift.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="837">Oh, I know! Why don't we head up the mountain?
I mean, it IS STARlight Night, after all.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Having dinner together was just the first part.
I wanna go out and look at the stars too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="838">The weather is nice tonight, so I'm sure the stars will be
beautiful. What say we go up the mountain to view them?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="839">&lt;nickname&gt;, you aren't sleepy, are you? Since it's

  <Entry Index="840">Guess what! Tonight's the one night all year when
the stars are the prettiest. Let's go up the mountain
and see them!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="841">The stars will be at their loveliest tonight. Can we go up
the mountain and see them?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="842">&lt;playername&gt;, let us go up the mountain and view the
beautiful stars together. I shall whisk us there in a flash!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="843">Say, &lt;nickname&gt;. On a night like this, don't you feel
like looking at the stars from high up?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Come, let us go up the mountain. I'm sure the winter
spirits are waiting for us.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="844">Oh, here. I got a Starlight Night present for you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="845">I got a ring!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="846">Pan paka paaan!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You've collected all seven rings! Congratulations!!!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...What? Yes, that's it. No, there isn't any special prize.
That's really all you get. Be grateful I did my special
cheer for you. Bye!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="847">Wooow... Coming up here sure was the right choice.
I hope we can do this together again next year.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="848">I wonder if Popuri is looking up at the stars right now.
She really loves them. I do too, really.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="849">Whoooa... The whole sky is just sparkling with stars!
I didn't think we'd see this many.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I wonder how many people are doing what we're doing,
looking up at this pretty sky...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="850">Man, first dinner, now this gorgeous scene? This has
been the best Starlight Night yet! Let's do this again
next year!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="851">Wooow. It's...beautiful.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
You could see a lot of stars from the town I used to
live in, but I think the view from here is the best.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="852">I could stay up here gazing at the stars all night...but
that's probably a bad idea. We should head home.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="853">I'm really glad we came up here. The stars just make
me feel at ease, and they look so close you could
almost touch them.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="854">Looks like you enjoyed the view. I know I did.
Huh. Maybe I'll make something star-shaped
at the Forge next...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="855">I wonder why the stars shine so brightly.
Perhaps they are trying to tell us something...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="856">Looking up at this vast sky in all its glory inspires me to
work hard tomorrow. Every day, a better me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="857">Brrr...! It's chillier than I thought. I hope I don't
catch a cold.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
But...I'm glad we came up here, &lt;nickname&gt;.
This starry sky is exquisite. It touches the soul.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="858">I wonder what it would take to infuse this grand and
majestic night sky into a single piece...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Ahhh, I can hardly wait for tomorrow! I want to delve
into my work while this feeling is still fresh in my mind.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="859">Reached mountain... But still too far...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="860">All the stars... Too tiny...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="861">Yes, yes. A very nice view. So many pretty stars.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="862">Now if only all these stars were coins... Oh, that would be
beautiful. Could they not fall down to me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="863">The view from here is positively delicious.
What a beautiful night. I am moved. Truly moved!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="864">Typically, I have little interest in the stars, as I can't eat
them. But this view feeds the soul. I love it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="865">Woohoo! The view from here is AMAZING! I've seen this
so many times, but I never get tired of it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="866">Every time is somehow different, you know? It's like the
sky and the mountain are listening, breathing...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It's weird. We humans have a way of forgetting that
we're not the only things in the world that are alive.&lt;wait&gt;
</Entry>
  <Entry Index="867">Look at all the stars... You know, after Mom
and Dad...passed away...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Grandma would bring me up here.
She could still walk then.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="868">She said that when I come up here, I can see Mom and
Dad whenever I want to...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="869">Boy, the sky's so full it's like all the stars are gonna fall
out. Ooh! Look! See! A shooting star! Aw, you missed it?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="870">Well darn. That's too bad... Ah, wait. I completely forgot
to make a wish! Nooooo!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="871">I don't know the names of any stars at all, but I really
love looking up at them.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="872">I wonder... Are there people on those stars looking up at
their sky and seeing our world as just another star?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="873">Did you know that the stars we see in the sky now
actually burned out and faded away long, long ago?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="874">But even though they're gone, they've still left a trace of
their presence that all can see. I'm a little jealous of that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="875">I spend most of my time above the clouds looking down
on the earth. Standing here and looking up is a refreshing
change.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="876">I would love to stay here with you all night drinking in
this wonder, but I'm afraid my work as a Goddess knows
no end.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
*sigh* I wish I could take some vacation days...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="877">Brrr...! Mountaintops in winter certainly are chilly.
I find myself dearly missing the warm auras of my sheep...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="878">But...though my body may be cold, the pure energy of the
stars warms my soul to the very core.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="879">Today was really something special. I had a lot of fun.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="880">Spending Starlight Night together with my family
was a real treat.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="881">The stars were so beautiful...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="882">...*THUMP*&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
OOF! Ow, ow, ow... My goodness. Sneaking into homes
is not as easy as it looks.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Hm...? Oh dear. They don't have a Stocking up.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Gracious, now where am I to put their presents? Hmmm.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I had the perfect gifts for them, too. But with nowhere
to put them, I guess I'll just have to go home.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="883">...*THUMP*&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
OOF! Ow, ow, ow... My goodness. Sneaking into homes
is not as easy as it looks.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Ah ha. Their Stockings is hung as it should be.
Wonderful. Now which present was theirs? It's so dark
I can barely see.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Hmm... *rummage* *rummage* Was it this one?
*rummage* *rummage* Maybe this one?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
...Eh. I'll just give them this one. There. Now then, off to
the next house. Ho ho ho!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="884">Present not defined. Please report debug issue.
&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

OOF! Ow, ow, ow... My goodness. Sneaking into homes
is not as easy as it looks.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Hm...? Oh my stars and garters! Their present from last
year is still in their Stocking!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I spent so much time picking out just the right one for
them, too... Perhaps they don't want any presents.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Ah well. I shall just have to go home and make use of this
sandwich blender myself, I suppose.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="886">Okay, everyone. You have patiently waited all night for
these special soba noodles, so without further ado...dig in!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="887">Oh dear. I wanted to be sure we had plenty of noodles,
but it looks like we wound up with extra ingredients.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
It would be a waste to throw them away, so why don't
you take some of the leftovers home?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="888">Uh oh. It looks like your Bag is full, &lt;playername&gt;.
I guess you can't take any leftovers. That's too bad.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="889">Mmm, that was delicious. I ate so much they're gonna
have to roll me home!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="890">Mmm, that was yummy! I ate way too much, though.
I'm more noodle than human now...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="891">Mmm, that was delicious! I've even got some leftovers
to take home too. That's a perfect day in my book!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="892">Mmm, that was delicious! I've even got some leftovers
to take home too. That's a perfect day in my book!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="893">They say soba noodles are good for your health.
That means I can have as much as I want! Hahaha!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="894">I'm just here to accompany Jeff, dear. Though, getting
soba noodles for free IS a nice perk.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="895">Mmm, I can't wait to chow down on some soba noodles!
They're a favorite of mine. ♪&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="896">Hello, hello! Have you come to enjoy some
tasty soba noodles, &lt;playername&gt;?
There are plenty for all, so eat your fill!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="897">Hey. You here for the noodles too?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
New Year's just isn't New Year's until you've had a good,
hot bowl of soba noodles, right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="898">Oh, why hello! Have you come to enjoy some soba noodles
too? Aren't they the best?! I love how light and silky
smooth they are. They just glide right down your throat!
Soba noodles by themselves are quite tasty, but put some
tempura on top and...mmm! Absolutely scrumptious!
Goodness, I've made myself hungry. Is it time to eat yet?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="899">The soba noodles we have on New Year's taste just
heavenly, don't they?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="900">Yo! You come lookin' for some soba too?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
On New Year's, you just gotta have a hot, steamin' bowl
of noodles, am I right?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="901">The sun ought to be rising soon...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="902">May this coming year be even better than the last...
For this town, and for everyone...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="903">A new year is about to start. It's hard to believe all
that's happened in this last one.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="904">I mean that in a good way.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="905">Time really does fly. The years just pass by before you
know it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="906">Yes... Looking back, I believe I can confidently bid farewell
to this year with no regrets.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="907">Spring is almost here. Both people and animals will get to

sun from here is especially beautiful, don't you think?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

You've collected all seven rings. Congratulations!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Your prize is bragging rights and...not much else. Enjoy!
Bye.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="953">&lt;playername&gt;, there's something I want to give you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="954">Wow, ah...this is really nerve-racking, isn't it?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="955">Um, you're always so nice to me, so I wanted
to thank you. And, ah, since i-it is White Day and all...here.
I hope you like it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="956">Here. This is for you. You got something for me for

  <Entry Index="959">I owe you a debt of gratitude for all you do for me, and
today is White Day, after all. So, here. This is for you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="960">Here, &lt;playername&gt;. As you gave me a gift for
Valentine's Day, it is only fitting that I give you one
in return.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="961">If you don't mind, there's something I would like
to give you. I hope that you like it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

person. Hope you like 'em.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="963">&lt;playername&gt;, since you got me a gift on Valentine's
and all, I got something for you too. Here!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="964">Yo! I dropped by because there's a little something
I wanted to give you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="965">Haha... Man, this is kinda embarrassin'.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="966">Here. Thanks for everything.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="967">You got me something for Valentine's, so here.
Hope you like it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="968">Hey. I came by because I've got somethin' for you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="969">Make what use of it that you will, I guess.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="970">I hear there is a custom of gift-giving today. I'm not one

kindness.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="971">Here. A little thank-you for your thoughtful gift on
Valentine's Day. It's nothing much, but I hope you'll find
it pleasing.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="973">*rummage* *rummage*&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="974">Well drat! Their Bag is full. Now what am I going to do?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="975">Yeah, they'll definitely notice if I stick it in their Bag.
...There! I can't wait to see their reaction.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="976">*rummage* *rummage*&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="977">Huh? Crap. Bag's full. Nothing for it but to give up,
I guess.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="978">I wonder how they'll react when they wake up
and notice it. Can't wait to find out.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="979">*rummage* *rummage*&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="980">Huh? Uh-oh. Their Bag's full. This won't fit.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="981">There, that should do it. I hope they like it...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="982">Huh? Crap! Their Bag's full! I don't have a back-up plan.
Now what...?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="983">Heh. Takes talent to fall dead asleep while still wearing
a Bag.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
There, perfect. They'll be so surprised. I wonder when
they'll wake up...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="984">There, perfect. They'll be so surprised.
I wonder when they'll wake up...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="985">*rummage* *rummage*&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="986">Oh, dear. It never occurred to me that their Bag
might be full. Now what to do?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="987">There. That ought to do it. They will notice soon after
they wake, I'm sure... Er, I hope.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="988">Drat! To think their Bag would be full. What a blunder.
I guess I have no choice but to abandon this folly.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="989">Goodness this is difficult. I was not expecting them to
wear their Bag whilst sleeping.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Ah well. It is in, and that is what counts. I await their
expression tomorrow morning with great anticipation.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="990">...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Asleep.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="991">Bag is full. When I brought a thing for them too.
Now I can't give.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="992">Brought a nice thing. I'll put in Bag. Look later. Okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="993">Aha. &lt;nickname&gt; sleeps, yes? Good.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="994">Ah. &lt;nickname&gt; sleeps deeply.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Oh no... Their Bag is full. And I had made cookies for
them too. Ah well. I will sell them instead, then.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="995">Ah. &lt;nickname&gt; sleeps deeply.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Perfect timing. I will put the cookies I made for them
for White Day into their Bag.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="996">Oh ho, it seems &lt;nickname&gt; is asleep.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="997">My, my. &lt;nickname&gt; is sound asleep.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I made them some truly delectable cookies for White
Day, but I don't want to wake them... Oh dear, and their
Bag is full, too.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="998">My, my. &lt;nickname&gt; is sound asleep.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I made them some truly delectable cookies for White
Day, but I don't want to wake them... Perhaps I'll just put
them in their Bag.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="999">Ugh, darn it! Their Bag is full. Of all the times...!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1000">And here I thought sticking these in their Bag would be
a great idea too. I guess it won't be that easy.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1001">Oh dear. Their Bag is full. Well, darn it. I guess I'll just
have to give up, then.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1002">I can't wait to see their reaction when they wake up.
*giggle* Look at them, all sound asleep.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1003">Huh? Their Bag is full? Well, cow patties! Now what
am I supposed to do?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1004">There, that should do it! They had darned well better like
it after all that.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1005">Aww, their Bag is all full. Geez, they really need to tidy
up and keep their stuff organized!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1006">*giggle* They're gonna be so surprised when they wake
up and find my present inside. I can't wait!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1007">Oh no... Their Bag is full. I didn't think of that. Goodness,
try to do something new and this is what happens.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1008">Hmmm... I hope they don't get crushed. Still...I can't wait
to see how they react tomorrow.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1009">There is no space in their Bag. It seems my surprise
faces an unyielding foe.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
A pity, but I guess that is simply the fate the stars have
decreed for today.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1010">There. My little surprise is safely tucked away in their
Bag. I can hardly wait for tomorrow.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1011">Oh my! Their Bag seems to be most full. And after all the
effort I made to bring a gift for them, too. Alas.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1012">My goodness, falling asleep while still wearing their Bag.
How cute.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Now if I simply put these in there... Yes! Perfect.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1013">Hey, do you know what tonight is? It's Moonlight Night.
So...want to look at the moon together?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1014">Ah. Look. The moon is something really special tonight.
Do you, um...want to sit and gaze at it with me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1015">I hear the Moonlight Night festival thing is tonight.
The moon's supposed to be really cool or somethin'.
Wanna look at it together?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1016">Oh yeah. Tonight's Moonlight Night. Wanna join me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1017">I wonder how clear it will be tonight. Hm? Why, you ask?
Because it's Moonlight Night. Care to join me?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1018">Moonlight Night, hm? I prefer to gaze upon the moon's
beauty alone...but I guess your company would be
acceptable.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1019">I'll join you!</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1020">I'm sleepy.</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1021">Great! I know we'll have a great time.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1022">O-Okay. Let's do that, then.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1023">Awesome! It's a date.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1024">Okay. Cool.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1025">Wonderful. I can't wait.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1026">All right. We will gaze upon its luminous face together.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1027">Ah...okay. That's too bad.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1028">You...don't want to? Oh. I see. That's too bad.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1029">Aww, but the moon's gonna be so awesome tonight!
Ah well. If you can't, you can't.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1030">Ah. It would be pretty late, yeah. Welp, good night, then.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1031">I see. A pity, but oh well.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1032">Ah. Oh well. I shall simply enjoy the beauties of the night
in peace by myself, then.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1033">Okay, time for bed...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1034">Okay, time for bed...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1035">&lt;playername&gt;, here. These are my way of saying
thanks for the present you gave me on Valentine's Day.
I hope you, um, like them.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1036">&lt;playername&gt;, thank you for the scrumptious
Valentine's Day cookies. Here, these are for you.
I hope you find them equally delectable.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1037">Oh, is it that late already? We should go, then.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1038">Um, since you were kind enough to invite me to come over

I thought I could at least make us something for dinner.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1039">Um...I hope you like it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1040">Oh, and this is for you too. A present to commemorate
tonight's Starlight Night.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1041">Yeah... Thanks.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1042">It won't be long now until the new year is here.

  <Entry Index="1043">I really enjoyed spending Starlight Night together
with Cliff.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1044">Aah, &lt;playername&gt;. You came. Wonderful. Now then,
let's invite Carter, as well.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1045">I must say, I'm really enjoying this. Most years, it's just
been Carter and me getting together for a simple dinner.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Making it a little party like this is quite refreshing.
I'm glad we could be here together.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1046">I heartily agree. After all, none of us have other family
here in town with whom we could celebrate.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1047">Spending Starlight Night together with you like this has
been lovely.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1048">I really enjoyed spending Starlight Night together

want dinner to go cold before we even eat.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1056">True... C'mon, let's eat.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1057">Have a seat, &lt;playername&gt;. Let's all sit down and
enjoy our Starlight Night dinner together.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1058">Have a seat, &lt;playername&gt;. Let's all sit down and

...With Grandpa too, of course.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1062">Grandpa, do you really have to bring that up today?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1063">What are you complaining about, boy? This is important!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
With some farm tools, one loose screw could put lives in
danger! You've got a long way to go if you can't see that!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1064">Ugh. Can we save the lecture and just eat now?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1065">Ah. By the way, I made this for you.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1066">Dunno if it's to your taste, but I hope you like it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1067">I really enjoyed spending Starlight Night together with
Gray and his grandpa.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1068">Ah, &lt;playername&gt;. You've arrived at precisely the
appointed time. Wonderful. Come, help me carry the food.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1069">There's just something 'bout sittin' down and havin'
a good meal with other folk that makes it all taste
better.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
See, I ain't the world's biggest talker, and Brandon talks
even less than me.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1070">Not so, Gotts. I simply prefer to enjoy a leisurely meal
in peace and quiet. That's all.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1071">Uh-huh. So why'd you go and invite &lt;playername&gt;
over to make a noisy party of it tonight then, eh?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1072">It's perfectly acceptable to do so for festivals and
special events.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Setting aside my art to drift in the tides of worldly life
for a time may bring me new inspiration, you know.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1073">Is that so. Welp, I'll take your word for it. Can't say as
I understand art or what it's like to be an artist.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1074">Ah well. What are fussy details on a night like this?
Let's just enjoy Starlight Night together, shall we?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1154">Oh geez! How did you manage to fall asleep while wearing
your Bag? Unbelievable...&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Hmmm...aha. There. Jammed it in. Heh.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1155">Umm...*rummage* *rummage*&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1156">Oh darn. I thought I could just put it in their Bag,
but there isn't any space. I suppose I'll just eat them
myself, then.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1157">I wonder if &lt;nickname&gt; will be up soon.
I really hope they like it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

Who the heck carries this much stuff?! Now what...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1160">WAH!! Geez, that startled me. ...It's okay. They didn't
wake up. Phew.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

  <Entry Index="1162">Aww, no way! There's so much stuff in their Bag that
this won't fit!&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I bet they'd be really mad if I took stuff out to put this
in too. Well fine, then! I'll eat it!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1163">They're sound asleep. Oh, I can't wait to see their face
when they wake up and find out. Tee hee!&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1164">*rummage* *rummage* ...Phew.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1165">Hm? Well...drat. Their Bag is full. Will I remember to give
this to them later? I'm not sure I will...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1166">I wonder, does &lt;nickname&gt; remember that today
is Valentine's Day?&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
Ah well. I'll just stuff these into their Bag.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1167">Their Bag is full. I wonder, are they simply not the tidy
sort? Ah well. I will just have to keep these for myself,
then.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

thinking to take off their Bag. Hmm, let's see...
Will these fit?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

They're sound asleep.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

I brought a gift for them too. Hmph! Well that's just
too bad. Bye-bye. ♪&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

How cute.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;

There. Perfect.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1172">Well, drat! Their Bag is full. Now what am I going to do?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1173">Hmm. They'll definitely notice if I stick it in their Bag.
...There! I can't wait to see their reaction when they
wake up.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1174">Hn? Crap. Bag's full. Nothing for it but to give up, I guess.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>

Now what...?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1179">Heh. Takes talent to fall dead asleep while still wearing
a backpack.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
There, perfect. They'll be so surprised. I wonder when
they'll wake up...&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1180">Oh dear. It never occurred to me that their Bag might
be full. Now what to do?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1181">There. That ought to do it. They will notice soon after
they wake, I'm sure. ...Er, I hope.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1182">Drat! To think their Bag would be full. What a blunder.
I guess I have no choice but to abandon this folly.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1183">To fall asleep whilst still wearing their Bag... I guess that
is a form of devotion to one's work? How inspiring.&lt;wait&gt;&lt;page&gt;
I hope it doesn't get mixed up with any of the other
things in here... All right. That should do it.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1184">Bag is full. When I brought a thing for them too.
Now I can't give.&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
  <Entry Index="1185">Brought a nice thing. I'll put in Bag. Look later. Okay?&lt;wait&gt;</Entry>
